Cheesecake is a must-have for many special occasions and holidays. But **how long does this delicious dessert last**? Is it possible to make ahead and freeze for later? Let’s find out! Cheesecake is made up of two main ingredients: cream cheese and eggs. This combination makes for a delicious and rich dessert, but it also means that cheesecake has a relatively short shelf life. But you can get more mileage out of your cheesecake if you take a few precautions. If you’re buying a pre-made cheesecake from the store, be sure to check the expiration date. Let’s find out **how long does cheesecake last.**



## How long does cheesecake last?

|                           |            |             |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| **Cheesecake**            | **Fridge** | **Freezer** |
| Cheesecake (homemade)     | 3 – 5 days | 1+ month    |
| Cheesecake (store-bought) | 5 – 7 days | 3+ months   |

The shelf life of cheesecake depends on a few factors: the cream cheese, eggs, and the other ingredients used in the recipe. Generally speaking, commercially made cheesecakes will have a longer shelf life than those made at home. That’s because the commercial versions use preservatives that help to extend their shelf life. Fresh cheesecake made at home will last for about 3-5 days in the fridge. After that, it’s best to freeze it. Cheesecake that has been frozen will last for about two months. While store-bought cake lasts for 7 days in the fridge and 3 months in the freezer.

## How to store cheesecake in the fridge?

Here are some tips for storing cheesecakes properly.

### Wrap it with plastic film

It should be wrapped in plastic film before being placed in the refrigerator. This will prevent the It from drying out and will keep it fresh for longer.

### Place it on a plate or tray

When storing the cake in the fridge, make sure to place it on a plate or tray. This will prevent it from absorbing any unpleasant fridge odors.

### Keep it in the fridge

Cheesecake should be kept in the fridge at all times. This will help to keep it fresh and prevent it from going bad.

## Can you freeze cheesecake?

Yes, you can freeze it! In fact, it’s a great way to extend the shelf life of this dessert. Just be sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil before freezing. The frozen cake will last for about two to three months.

When you’re ready to eat your frozen cake, thaw it overnight in the fridge or for about four hours at room temperature. Be sure to allow it to come to room temperature before serving, as this will help ensure that it is soft and creamy.

## How to tell if cheesecake has gone bad?

Generally, it will last about 5-7 days in the fridge. After that time has passed, the cheesecake quality will start to go downhill.

The signs that your cake has gone bad are pretty similar to other cakes.

**Mold:** If you see any mold growing on it, it hasn’t gone well and should not be eaten. Mold is dangerous to consume, no matter where it grows on the food. It would help if you discarded any cake that has mold on it.

**Off Odor:** If your cake smells bad, or even just a little bit off, it has gone bad, and you should not eat it. The smell might be faint, but if you notice anything strange about how your cake smells, it is best to discard it.

**Unusual Color:** If you see any color changes, especially around the edges of the cheesecake, it hasn’t gone bad. The color changes are often a sign of mold starting to form.

If your cheesecake exhibits any of these signs, it is best to throw it out. The cake does not last as long as other cakes, so it is important to watch it. You can make sure your cake lasts as long as possible by following these tips.

## How long can cheesecake last at room temperature?

Cheesecake can last for only 6 hours at room temperature. This is because the high sugar and dairy content can cause bacteria to grow. If you want to store your cheesecake for a longer period of time, it is best to keep it in the fridge.

## Summary

Cheesecake is a dessert that usually consists of a crust made from cookies, graham crackers, or pie crust, a filling made from cheese, eggs, and cream, and a topping. The lifespan of cheesecake varies based on the ingredients and preparation methods used.

Cheesecake can last in the fridge for up to a week, but it is best consumed within the first few days. Cheesecake can also be frozen for up to two months. When stored properly, the cheesecake will maintain its quality and flavor for a longer period of time.
