  ## How long does sweet potato pie last in the freezer?

  ## How to know if sweet potato pie has gone bad?


  If you are unsure whether your sweet potato pie is edible or not then you can get help from my tips and guide below.


  ### Check Color


  Sweet potato pie is brown in color, if your sweet potato pie has changed color or has some weird green spots (I’m not even sure how that would happen) then don’t eat it.


  ### Check Texture


  If the texture of your sweet potato pie is different than usual, for example, gooey and sticky, then don’t eat it.


  ### Smell it!


  If the smell of your sweet potato pie is different than before like some weird chemical smell, then don’t eat it. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Don’t risk your health. Throw away any questionable food. If you see anything that resembles mold on sweet potato pie, throw it out! Mold (fungus) can be dangerous for your health.


  The best way to prevent food poisoning is by handling and storing food properly. Fresh sweet potato pie will last 24 hours in the fridge (if you don’t eat it all). If you want to keep your pie longer then move it into an airtight container or wrap tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap.


  Don’t let your sweet potato pie go bad by storing it longer than the recommended time in the fridge, freezer, or pantry! If you are not sure what to do with your food, ask yourself these questions:


  ### Is my refrigerator at the right temperature?


  The ideal temperature is 40°F or below. When it comes to your freezer, the ideal temperature is 0°F.


  ### Was I refrigerating my food properly?


  * Never set your refrigerator above 40°F or your freezer above 0°F.

  * Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold! Don’t let food sit out for over 2 hours. This is when bacteria start to grow on your food


  ### Was I defrosting my food properly?


  * Never defrost or marinate food at room temperature! This is when bacteria start to grow on your food.

  * Always thaw in the refrigerator. If you are short on time, it’s okay to thaw food under cool water — just make sure the water doesn’t touch the food.

  * For casseroles or large items, place them in a leak-proof bag first then into a pan of cold water. Change the water every half hour to an hour for faster thawing.

  * When marinating food, set it on a plate so any juices don’t drip onto other food. The juices may contain bacteria that cause food poisoning.

  * Never re-freeze once it’s been thawed! After you take your frozen or refrigerated foods out to thaw them, only thaw the amount of food that you’re planning on eating in that sitting. If you decide to eat something else later in the day, freeze the rest immediately.


  ### How was my food stored?


  Bacteria grow in moist, warm conditions. Be sure to store everything airtight! This will make your foods last longer and prevent bacteria from growing on them! Is it hot in here? It sounds like you need an air-tight container.


  ### Am I using the right utensils and surfaces to prepare my food?


  Don’t use a plate that held raw meat unless you’ve washed it thoroughly. Never put cooked or ready-to-eat foods on a plate that has been in contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs! I recommend you use color-coded cutting boards for each type of food.


  When cooking or baking, use a clean spoon to stir the **[food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food)**. Always wash your hands before you handle any food! There are probably germs on your hands too.


  ### Is there something wrong with my leftovers?


  Reheated food is safe to eat as long as it is hot all the way through. However, the taste and texture may not be as good as it was when first served.


  When reheating, use a microwave on medium to high heat until steam rises from the food. Stir every 30 seconds to evenly distribute the heat (I know I already said that but it’s important!).


  ## F.A.Q


  ### How long can I store my food in the freezer?


  The freezer will make your food last up to 6 months! But when in doubt, throw it out!


  ### Will canned goods still be safe after their expiration date?


  No. It is very dangerous because it could contain botulism. Botulites produce toxins that can be deadly. Don’t eat anything from a can if the can appears bloated, has dents, or is rusting.


  ### To keep my food fresh in the fridge, what should I do?


  Make sure your fridge temperature is between 40°F and 32°F! Store your leftovers in air-tight containers or re-sealable plastic bags. Also, always set your refrigerator and freezer to the right temperatures! If you’re not sure what those are, here they are:\

  -Freezer: 0°F\

  -Refrigerator: 40°F or below


  ### My food looks like it’s growing something. Is it still safe?


  If it’s just a spot of mold, you can cut off the mold and eat the rest. If it has more than one spot of mold, throw it out! If your food is crawling with maggots or other bugs, I hope you weren’t planning on eating it.
