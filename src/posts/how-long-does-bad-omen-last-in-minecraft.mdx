  A bad omen is a curse that you can get on your player if you visit the Nether
  and return to the Overworld without killing a silverfish. Every bad omen point
  will add some negative effects: some of them, like Night Vision or Health
  Boost, will only last until you log off Minecraft, while others, like the
  Hunger effect, will last until you die.


  Only 50 bad omen points can be acquired: if you get more than that, even after dying and getting them to reset, they won’t add further negative effects.


  The duration of a given effect caused by a curse is random: it can vary from 1 to 12 minutes but, most of the time, it’s between 3 and 11 minutes. There are some exceptions, though: Night Vision, for example, is always 30 seconds long while Blindness is always 2 minutes long.


  The effects of bad omens can be temporarily neutralized if you eat a golden apple or drink milk, but they’ll come back after some time.

## How Long Does Bad Omen Last in Minecraft?

Bad omen last for **100 minutes** (i.e., **1 hour and 40 minutes**).

The bad omen point counter will reset if you die (so you could log off and back on again, and it will start from 0), but its effects won’t: they’ll last until the 100 minutes limit is reached or until the player logs off Minecraft, whichever comes first.

Some negative effects, like Hunger, Suspension, and Mining Fatigue, will last until the player dies, while others, like Blindness or Night Vision, will only last until you log off.
