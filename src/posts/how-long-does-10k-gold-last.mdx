## How long does 10k gold last?

![How Long Does 10K Gold Last](/img/how-long-does-10k-gold-last-300x169.jpg "How Long Does 10K Gold Last")

The life of 10K gold jewelry depends on how well you take care of it. Here is a list of things you can do for your gold to ensure that it shines and stays as new as possible:

1. Do not wear the ring or any other 10k gold jewelry when at home, doing housework such as washing dishes, doing the laundry, or gardening. Soap and water damages gold.
2. Remove your jewelry before you go to sleep, so it is not exposed to sweat and body oils while you are sleeping. Sweat and body oil cause tarnished spots on 10k gold jewelry.
3. Have your jewelry checked for repairs once a year.

The life span of a 10k gold piece will also depend on the individual who wears it. Some people don’t care for their jewelry as much as others, and they may take it off to sleep or during certain activities, which can cause scratches and other appearance damage. In addition, some individuals have skin that reacts with gold causing discoloration and tarnishing.

## Will 10k gold last forever?

No. Since 10k gold is not pure, it tends to wear off over time. However, you can also speed up this process if you take care of your ring wrong. Doing so much damage in just a few months will immensely affect your jewelry.

However, the lifespan of a 10k gold is very long as compared to other metals.

## Does 10K gold scratch easily?

Yes, it does. 10k gold is a mixture of copper and zinc with only 41.7% pure gold, so naturally, it can be scratched and damaged far more easily than 18K and 14K solid gold.

However, many pieces of 10k gold jewelry are combined with other metals such as silver or even semi-precious stones like diamonds or sapphires. These pieces increase the beauty of the jewelry and protect 10k gold from scratching and other types of damage.

10K gold is also one of three common karats that are used to make jewelry. The others include:

* 18K (75% pure gold)
* 22K (91.6% pure gold)

## How fast does 10k gold tarnish?

10k gold is **[alloyed](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/matse81/node/2141)** with copper and zinc (which are more susceptible to corrosion). Thus, tarnishing may happen faster than you expected. However, there are many ways to avoid this.

One of them is to limit your exposure of the 10k gold jewelry to water. Water can result in pitting on some pieces due to prolonged exposure. I would recommend using a soft cotton cloth to dry your gold jewelry after washing your hands or taking a shower.

Another way to avoid tarnishing is by regularly cleaning the 10k gold piece, not building up dirt and grime. A mild soap and water mixture should do the trick when it comes time to clean your 10k gold.

## How to remove tarnish on 10k gold?

You can follow the tips given below to remove the tarnish from your 10k gold jewelry.

### Soak in Baking Soda

Make a paste by mixing baking soda with water. Apply this paste onto the tarnished area and let it sit for about 2 hours. After that, scrub it with an old toothbrush or cloth until you see results. Rinse your jewelry well after that, then dry it with a soft cloth to prevent future tarnishing.

### Use Vinegar

Pour some vinegar into a bowl and slowly drop your 10k gold jewelry piece into the solution. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, then use old toothbrushes to scrub the tarnished area gently. Rinse it off with water afterward. Dry thoroughly afterward to protect against future tarnishing.

### Use Ammonia

Mix some ammonia with water, then drop your gold jewelry piece in the solution. Leave it there for about 5 minutes and scrub using an old toothbrush or cloth to get rid of the tarnish. Rinse and dry well afterward.

### Wipe Them Down

Polishing your 10k gold regularly can cut down on the amount of tarnishing that occurs over time.\
However, if you use the right jewelry cleaning products and maintain your 10k gold properly, it will be sure to last a long time without tarnishing too much.

## Tips on how to keep the shine of 10k gold jewelry

* Store them in a cool, dry place, so they do not get damaged or tarnished
* Always clean it with a soft cotton cloth to avoid any scratches on the surface of the 10k gold.
* Avoid using cleaning products that contain ammonia or vinegar because these substances can strip away the thin layer of protection surrounding your solid 10k gold jewelry.

## Conclusion

A 10k gold piece has a good shine, and you can clean the jewelry with the help of the above method. However, if your ring needs to be repaired or adjusted, then contact us we will guide you on what to do further. Thank You!
