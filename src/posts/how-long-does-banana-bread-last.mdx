<!--StartFragment-->

| Banana Bread | Last For |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Fridge       | 4 Days   |
| Freezer      | 1 Year   |

Banana bread can last for 4 days on the counter and 1 week in the fridge. When stored in the freezer, it can last for 1 year.

After 4 days on the counter, the bread will start dry, and yet it is edible. After 1 year in the freezer, it can be edible but not as moist.

## How to store banana bread properly?

Depending on your consumption, you can store this bread on the counter, fridge, and freezer. Below is the step-by-step guide to store it on the counter, refrigerator, and freezer.

**Steps to store on the counter:**

If you have a whole loaf of bread, let it come to room temperature before eating it. Please leave it in plastic wrap or in the paper bag it came in. If you want a softer crust, store the bread uncovered or not wrapped at all but keep it away from direct sunlight and heat.

**Steps to store in the refrigerator:**

Wrap the whole loaf of bread tightly with plastic wrap and put it in a zip lock bag. Store the zip lock bag on the side or on top of something to raise it above other food items. This way, you will prevent leaking and keep your items away from getting the freezer burned.

**Steps to store in the freezer:**

Wrap the whole loaf of bread tightly with plastic wrap. Put it in a zip lock bag. Throw away the bag that it came in because it is not strong enough for freezing. Place the bagged bread on its side so that they are easier to grab when you take out slices. Once the bread is frozen, you can store it upright. Make sure to place a paper towel in-between each slice, so they do not stick together.

When eating the banana bread from the freezer, defrost it at room temperature before serving or put it in the microwave for a few seconds. This way, you will avoid having crumbs all over your plate, and the bread will be easier to cut and eat.

**For baking:**

**Steps to bake from frozen:**

Let the whole loaf of bread come to room temperature before baking it, or else it will fall flat while baking. You can take the slices out of the freezer and defrost them at room temperature for a few hours. Preheat the **[oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oven)** to 350 F and bake the bread for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let it cool for about 30 minutes before taking out slices, or else you will get a gooey mess.

## How to tell if banana bread has gone bad?

Banana bread can spoil easily, so you want to check it constantly before eating. Banana bread starts to spoil when there are blue or green spots on the crust, and mold starts growing at the bottom of the bread. If you cut into a slice and notice any white or black dots, throw away that slice, and the whole loaf for it could be contaminated with bacteria.

When the bread has a sour smell or if it is too gooey or gritty, the bread is spoiled and should not be eaten. Banana Bread’s life span can vary depending on how long you keep it for consumption and how you store it. The amount of time you keep this bread for consumption does not matter as much as how you store it after buying it.

When storing banana bread, you will have a different life span depending on keeping the bread on the counter, fridge, or freezer. Keeping the bread in the freezer for over a year is not suggested since the moisture will dry out and leave a tasteless piece of bread that is hard to swallow. You also want to check your banana bread frequently for signs of mold and spoilage to make sure you are eating a fresh piece.

## F.A.Q

### Does banana bread go bad?

Yes, it can go bad. If you keep it in a moist and warm place, the bread will spoil quickly, so make sure to put it in an airtight container or a warp bag. You will know when the bread is spoiled because of its smell and appearance.

### Does homemade banana bread need to be refrigerated?

Normally, homemade bread does not need to be refrigerated. You can keep it in an airtight container or a warp bag that will make it fresh for 4-5 days. However, if you are not going to consume it within 4-5 days, you need to keep it in the fridge to prevent mold.

### Why does my banana bread smell sour?

If your banana bread smells sour, it has spoiled. You should not eat the bread under any circumstances because it could have bacteria that are harmful to you. If you have already eaten some of the bread, throw up immediately, so the bacteria does not get into your system and make you sick.

### What is freezer burn?

Freezer burn can occur when there is too much moisture in the freezer when storing your bread. This will leave a white and dry spot on your banana bread that can ruin its taste and quality. You should avoid freezing in humid areas and wrap it properly with plastic to prevent freezer burn.

### Are bananas too rotten for bread?

Yes, if your bananas are too rotten for eating, you can still use them to make banana bread. If the bananas have gone bad and you do not want to waste them, put them in the freezer, so they do not go to waste. All you need is to take out the frozen bananas and let them thaw before using them in baking.

## Summary

Banana bread can spoil quickly, depending on how you store it. It is best to keep it in an airtight container or bag and regularly check for signs of mold and discoloration.
