## What is a Silk Press?

A silk press is a procedure to straighten curly or frizzy hairs using heat, pressure/comb technique. It is done by applying heat and then combing, holding the hair down with either your hands or pressing on it with something flat like a countertop.

A silk press can last anywhere from 1-2 months generally. And although it is called a silk press, it has nothing to do with the material ‘silk’.

## How Long Does A Silk Press Last?

For straight hair: Straightening hairs, i.e., making them smooth, sleek, and frizz-free, will prolong a silk press so it can last up to 3 to 5 weeks. You can also use low heat or medium heat to lessen the risks of burning yourself.

For curly or frizzy hairs: The silk press will last only 2 to 3 weeks if you have curly or frizzy hair because heat causes curls/frizz to come back. In this case, it’s best to avoid heat and try a different straightening method such as a flat iron or braid waves.

## How To Make A Silk Press Last Longer?

Here are some tips to make your silk press last longer:

1. Don’t shampoo your hair the day before and use a heat-protecting product (spray, serum, mousse) before applying heat.
2. Use heat on low or medium settings; high will burn your hair.
3. Do not use too much heat on your comb; just enough to straighten your hair.
4. Avoid washing your hair every day and only shampoo with cold water once or twice a week. You can also rinse with water, but remember that you have to moisturize more often if you don’t use shampoo.
5. Keep your hair moisturized, make it a habit to deep condition or use hot oil treatments at least once a week (or even more if you like).
6. Do not comb through wet hair; comb after taking a shower. Comb first with a wide tooth and then narrow it down using the other side of the same comb (wide tooth). Or you can use a natural bristle brush.
7. On the go? Try applying some water on your comb to smooth down your hairs when they are dry; just wipe off excess water before using it on your hair.
8. Do not tug or pull on your tangles, be gentle with brushing, especially if you have fragile ends.
9. Comb your hair in sections to avoid pulling and tugging on one area for too long.
10. Use a satin cap or satin scarf at night if you don’t have a silk pillowcase. Cotton is the enemy of the silk press, so cover up with no more than 50% cotton if necessary.
11. Tend to your hair often, eat a balanced diet and drink lots of water.
12. On the days that you shampoo your hair skip brushing and combing them to avoid unnecessary breakage. Instead, braid or bun up your hair at night.

## Do Silk Press Damage Your Hair?

In normal cases, silk press is not bad for your hair. However, if you are applying too much heat, then it may cause your hair to become dry, frizzy, and in some cases, brittle. The trick is in how long you need to keep the heat on your hair and how often you can use a silk press until it becomes too much.

The proper precautions are taken, plus moisturizing, conditioning, and moisturizing treatments, which will be great for anyone who wants to have a silk press.

## How To Care For Your Hair

So what should you do after a silk press? First, rinse your hair with cold water. Avoid hot water because it will open up the hair follicles and cause hair breakage. Then use conditioner or deep-conditioning treatment to prevent hair damage.

**Further tips:** Wrap your wet head in a towel to remove excess water, comb hair with a wide tooth before applying heat. Use your fingers to wrap your hair around the iron. If you are using an electric straightener, make sure not to cover more than 2 inches of hair on the plates. Keep the temperature at a medium or low setting and slowly go over sections on your head for about 15 seconds.

So if you want to know how long does a silk press last then the simple answer is 1-2 months.
