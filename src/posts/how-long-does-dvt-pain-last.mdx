  Are you experiencing DVT pain? And do you want to know **how long does DVT
  pain last?** This article is all about it. **DVT** stands for **deep vein
  thrombosis**. It is a serious condition where blood clots develop in the
  muscles of your legs. Blood clots are formed by tangled masses of thickened
  blood elements that form together inside blood vessels to reduce oxygen
  transport around your body.


  DVT can be caused by a wide range of factors: surgery, cancer, trauma to the legs or pelvis, obesity, and hormonal changes during pregnancy. But most commonly, DVT is caused due to sitting in one position for too long. It’s known as an economy class syndrome. If you are inactive for a long time, your blood flow slows down, and blood clots can develop.


  When these clots travel to your lungs, it causes pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention. Symptoms for DVT include pain or swelling in one of the legs, especially the calf; increased warmth over the affected area; redness of skin on the leg; pain when moving or pressing on the leg.


  If you experience any of these symptoms, go to the doctor as soon as possible for further examination and treatment. If DVT is diagnosed in time, your chances of recovery are very good, but if it’s too late, it can lead to serious conditions like disability or death. This condition is called venous thromboembolism.

## How long does DVT pain last?

![How long does DVT pain last?](/img/how-long-does-dvt-pain-last-300x169.jpg "How long does DVT pain last?")

When DVT is identified and treated early, it can go away within a few days or weeks. But before the condition goes away, you will experience sharp and cramping pain in your legs which is sometimes accompanied by swelling and skin redness. The pain usually begins in the calf but may spread to the thighs and buttocks. The thrombosis may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and fever.

## How long does it take for pain from a blood clot to go away?

As stated by the NHS, DVT pain may last for up to 3 or 4 weeks. But if you experience ongoing pain and swelling, it might signify another condition like chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). CVI is another kind of DVT which occurs when valves in your veins don’t work properly. If treatment for DVT fails, surgery may be necessary. CVI symptoms include itchy skin and aching muscles, which can last for up to a year or two after the DVT has been diagnosed.

## Does pain from DVT go away?

In most cases, DVT pain goes away once the blood clots have been dissolved with medication and the affected vein is reopened so that blood can flow through it again. In some cases, though, a condition called **Post Thrombotic Syndrome** may develop. It causes ongoing leg pain and other symptoms even after the initial DVT has gone away. The pain is caused by damage to the veins, which can be triggered by blood clots.

The best way to ease the pain and reduce swelling in your leg is regular exercise, but make sure you consult with your doctor before starting any new activity because there are some limitations when it comes to exercising while having DVT. So keep yourself active, eat healthily, and don’t sit in one place for too long. And if you experience any symptoms, go to the doctor as soon as possible.

## What is the treatment process of DVT?

If you experience any of the common DVT symptoms, it’s best to visit your doctor and undergo a physical examination to see whether you have DVT. Your doctor will check for swelling and tenderness in your leg and thigh and will probably order some tests like ultrasound or venous Doppler studies. If those test results are positive, treatment usually involves anticoagulants like heparin or warfarin that will thin the blood and prevent new clots from forming.

If you’re pregnant, you will be prescribed heparin only. If your DVT is treated in time, there is no damage to the deeper veins and muscles of your legs, so they will not be affected by the clot. But if DVT goes untreated, it can lead to serious conditions like pulmonary embolism, which needs immediate medical attention and might even require surgery.

## How do you relieve DVT pain?

To relieve pain caused by DVT, you can try walking, massage, heating pads, or ice packs. Don’t stay in one place for too long, and drink plenty of water to reduce leg swelling. Apply moisturizer on your skin to avoid itching. Check out these natural remedies for DVT pain relief if you want to ease the pain.

## Conclusion

DVT pain is sharp and cramping, which comes with fever, swelling, redness in the legs or thighs, nausea, or vomiting. The condition can go away within a few days or weeks if immediately diagnosed but can lead to other conditions like CVI, which might cause constant leg pain even after the initial blood clot has gone away. Make sure you visit your doctor as soon as you experience any symptoms and follow their instructions to ease the pain and reduce swelling.

If you’re pregnant, make sure to inform your doctor about any DVT symptoms because heparin is all that will be given in such cases.
