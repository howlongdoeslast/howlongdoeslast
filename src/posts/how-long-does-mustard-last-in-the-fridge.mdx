  Mustard is one of the notorious and full of aroma condiments that are not
  doubted to be included in any meal. There are many recipes that demand the use
  of mustard like Hot Dogs, but what you also need to know is **how long does
  mustard last in the fridge.**


  The shelf life of mustard depends on various factors, such as its freshness and ingredients. We will discuss the shelf life of mustard after opening and if left unopened.


  Mustard becomes stale or rancid when it is exposed to oxygen, which occurs after the jar is opened. Storing in the Fridge slows this process down but not completely. The acidity of mustard prevents it from becoming contaminated with bacteria that cause food spoilage. This counts as a factor in the long-term storage of mustard.
