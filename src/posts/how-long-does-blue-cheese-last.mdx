Cheese is a by-product of milk, naturally containing a low pH and high amounts of protein. During the cheese-making process, lactic acid bacteria are introduced to milk, causing it to curdle and lowering its ph. The addition of salt causes the proteins in the milk to tighten together, forming what we know as cheese.

There are many types of cheese available in the market today. Blue cheese, which is also known as Roquefort, is often characterized by its moist, slightly sticky texture and deep green veins of mold throughout the interior. But you should know **how long does blue cheese last**; if you don’t know, then keep reading.

One thing to keep in mind when purchasing cheese is that there are different kinds available in the supermarket today. The most common variety found in American grocery stores is made with cow’s milk, while the traditional French Roquefort is made with sheep or goat’s milk.

Often, cheese can be preserved for a long time if properly handled and stored. The best conditions for storing the cheese are in a refrigerator with an ideal temperature of 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

## How long does blue cheese last?

You can keep blue cheese for 3-4 weeks in the refrigerator before it goes bad. If you want to store blue cheese for longer, then you can freeze it. In the freezer, blue cheese can last for many years.

If we talk about the unopened blue cheese, then it has a shelf life of 6 months. However, once you open a blue cheese, then you can use it within 3-4 weeks.

Keep in mind that if your cheese has started to change color or if it has an unusual smell, then throw the blue cheese out and do not consume it.

Some brands mentioned on their product that you should consume the product within 5-7 days, so you have to check the expiry date on the label before purchasing it.

## How to tell if blue cheese has gone bad?

There are many ways to check whether your cheese is able to eat or it has gone bad. So let me tell you how you can check by yourself.

### Smell it

If your cheese has gone bad, then it will have a very strong unpleasant odor. This is the primary sign of your cheese gone bad.

### Appearance

If you see mold on the cheese, then it has gone bad, so throw it out. Also, if your blue cheese starts to change color, throw it out. When you cut a piece of blue cheese, and if its interior has changed from creamy white to yellow or brown, then it is no longer edible.

### Weight your cheese

Another simple way to check whether your cheese has gone bad or not is by weighing it. If it has lost its original weight, then you should throw the cheese. It will be more than 3% of its original weight, so this is a very clear indication that your cheese has gone bad.

If you eat blue cheese before its expiry, it can cause foodborne illness, leading to nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

## How to store blue cheese properly?

In order to store blue cheese properly, you need to store it in a cool and dry place. Below is the method that you can follow to store it properly.

### Store in Refrigerator

The easiest way to store cheese is through a refrigerator. You can keep it in your refrigerator at a 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit temperature. This is the perfect temperature for storing blue cheese, so you do not have to worry about its quality.

Keep in mind that once you open it, you need to store it properly. There are no extra precautionary steps for unopened cheese, but after opening it, you need to wrap it in plastic and cover it with aluminum foil.

Once you are done using cheese, immediately put it back in the refrigerator. Do not let the cheese sit out for a long time because when the temperature is higher than 40 degrees Fahrenheit, then blue cheese starts sweating, which can cause spoilage.

### Freezing Blue Cheese

You can freeze your cheese, but make sure you store it properly. If you do not know how to freeze blue cheese, go through the instructions below.

1. First of all, wrap your cheese in aluminum foil or freezer paper and then put it in a freezer bag.
2. Now place the storage bag containing wrapped blue cheese at the bottom of a freezer.
3. Remove the blue cheese from the freezer every time you need to use it and place it in a refrigerator. This way, your cheese will remain fresh for a longer period.
4. Thaw the bag in a refrigerator once you are done using your blue cheese and not at room temperature because even 40 degrees **[Fahrenheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit)** can melt your cheese.

Please keep in mind that once you thaw the cheese, then eat it within 3-4 days, or else it will go bad. To use, unwrap and cut into chunks to let them reach room temperature before serving.
