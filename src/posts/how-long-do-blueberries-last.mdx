| Blueberries | Shelf Life |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Shelf       | 1-2 Days   |
| Fridge      | 10 Days    |
| Freezer     | 6 Months   |

If you are going to eat your blueberry in one or two days, then you can keep them on the shelf, and itâ€™s safe as well. However, if you want to store them for later, then you can store them in the fridge for 10 days. Moreover, if you want to make them longer, then you have the option to freeze them. In the freezer, blueberry can last for 6 months.

## How to tell if blueberries have gone bad?

Just like any other fruit, a blueberry can easily go bad when not stored properly. The sugar and water content in blueberries is what causes them to go bad so easily.

Here are some of the signs that your blueberry has gone bad:

### Mold or fungus

If you notice any kind of mold or fungus growing on your fruit, then this also means that it has caused damage to the inside as well and thus is not safe to eat at all. If you notice any of these signs, just throw them away as they can cause serious health issues.

The white coating looks like mold, but itâ€™s actually a natural chemical reaction due to high acidity and polyphenol oxidase enzymes ( tyrosinase ).

### A change in color

If your blueberry starts having a uniform dark blue color instead of its original dark purple hue, you should immediately get rid of it because it also means that your fruit is not fresh anymore.

### A sour smell

Sometimes when you open a pack of blueberries, they may have a slight smell which is actually good for the fruit, but if you start noticing strong odors, then this is also a sign that your blueberry has gone bad and is not safe to eat anymore.

So, these were the signs you need to look out for if you want to know if they went bad. As we have been told before, storage plays an important part in keeping your fruit fresh, so make sure to store it properly. If you do not know how to store them properly, read on.

## Why is there white stuff on blueberry?

If you are wondering what that white stuff on blueberries is, then you should know that it is actually a natural chemical reaction due to high acidity and polyphenol oxidase enzymes (**[tyrosinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosinase)**).

### Why does this happen?

Blueberries contain acids such as malic and citric acids, which make the berries taste very good. These acids react with the enzymes polyphenol oxidase in the fruit, which causes the white substance or residue on your blueberry.

This coating is, also called bloom, forms on your blueberry, and it is a protective layer that protects it from bacteria. It has different flavors, textures, and aromas, which you will not find in other berries. It is also called epicuticular wax.

Donâ€™t worry about this residue because itâ€™s completely harmless, but if you want, you can reduce the amount of white stuff on your blueberries by following simple steps:

**Preparation:**Â Wash blueberries in cold water and drain them in a colander, then let them air-dry. Dry blueberries can be stored for up to 1 week in the refrigerator, or you can freeze them.

**Storage:**Â Store your blueberries in cold storage such as refrigerators at 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit. Avoid storing wet blueberries with other berries because the moisture will affect the quality of other fruits.
