## What is a Hyaluron Pen?

A hyaluronic pen is a medical device for the injection of fluids. It has been used in plastic surgery to correct wrinkles or fine lines around the eyes, mouth, and neck. This is a simple way to remove you from the stress of aging skin with no side effects.

You can also use it for lip enhancement. But if you want to use it for lip enhancement, we recommend you consult your dermatologist first and know more information about this treatment before buying a Hyaluron pen online.

## How Does Hyaluron Pen Work?

The liquid, which is injected through a Hyaluron pen, also called a hyaluronic acid filler or HA fillers, is non-permanent and will be absorbed into your body over time.

The liquid stimulates collagen production by the dermis to improve your skin’s texture and diminish wrinkles. It makes you look younger and enhances self-confidence too.

## How Long Does Hyaluron Pen Last?

Hyaluron pens are available in different dosage strengths to achieve the desired results. The most commonly hyaluronic acid filler is the 20mg/ml concentration, lasting for 4-6 months. Another one is 40mg/ml, which can last for 6-12 months on average.

Its results will last for a few years, but you can touch up as needed to maintain your refreshed appearance.

## How Long Does Hyaluron Pen Lip Filler Last?

The effect of the Hyaluron pen lasts for 3-6 months on lips. Sometimes for more than six months.

Hyaluron lip filler is suitable for both permanent and temporary treatment of wrinkles, including the lip area. It has a quick onset of effect within about an hour after application, and it can last up to six months or sometimes even longer. The Hyaluron pen works by injection with the aid of a micro-needle. This needle is so tiny that the skin barely absorbs it.

Hyaluron lip filler consists mainly of hyaluronic acid, a substance produced by the body itself, which has a vital role in the proper hydration of the skin. The aim is to create fullness and volume by filling wrinkles or scars on, for example, the lips.

This pen is the most preferred method of hyaluronic acid injection because it’s very easy to use. It has also been shown in studies that six months after treatment with lip filler, no side effects are visible.

## Is Hyaluron Pen FDA Approved?

No,[ the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-brief-fda-warns-public-and-health-care-professionals-not-use-needle-free-devices-injection) has not approved any Hyaluron pen or acid. Actually, FDS has warned people to avoid these kinds of acid treatments. FDA also added that these types of dermal fillers treatment could be hazardous. Note: this article is only for educational purposes, and I am not endorsing you to use any kind of Hyaluron pen or acid.

## What is Hyaluronic Acid?

Hyaluron acid is a substance produced by the body itself, which has an important role in the proper hydration of the skin. The aim is to create fullness and volume by filling wrinkles or scars on, for example, the lips.

Hyaluronic acid is used for the lips and to rejuvenate facial features like cheeks and nasolabial folds. Patients who have undergone a facelift or dermal fillers injections experience volume loss in the treated area, which is the usual problem with hyaluronic acid.

## What are the Benefits of Hyaluron Pen?

There are some benefits as well that you can note down.

### Needles Less:

The needle is very thin and tiny, so the skin absorbs it easily and painlessly. So injection becomes less painful.

### Lower Dose:

Volume loss in treated areas is the usual problem with hyaluronic acid fillers. But the Hyaluron pen used a lower dose of product to produce desired results.

### Less swelling:

Swelling is common after hyaluronic acid filler injection, but the Hyaluron pen produces less swelling.

### Smooth Texture:

Hyaluron pen gives a smooth and soft texture to lips after injection.

### Less downtime:

There is no need for any downtime with this treatment as it’s very easy and safe to use. However, you may feel redness or bruise after injection, which will subside within a couple of days.

### Quick Effects:

Hyaluron pen gives quick effects as compared to other dermal fillers; hence it’s called the fastest effect filler.

## What are the Side effects of the Hyaluron Pen?

If you are going to use this filler treatment, you should be aware of the risk factors.

### Infection**:**

Infection can occur after injection as incision sites are at risk of infection. So it’s essential that patients take proper care that avoids chances of bacterial or viral infections.

### Raise eyebrows:

Hyaluron pen raises eyebrows, so you have to maintain your normal eyebrow position before using this treatment.

### Bleeding:

It can occur after injection because puncture sites are at risk of bleeding. So it’s important that the patient should take proper care, which avoids chances of bruising or clotting under the skin.

### Irritation:

Irritations can appear in areas where treatment is given, like redness, swelling, itching, etc. These side effects are common, but if they do not subside within a few days, then you should consult your doctor.

## When not to Use Hyaluron Pen Treatment?

If you are allergic to Hyaluron or any of its components like lidocaine hydrochloride, benzyl alcohol, etc.

If you have a skin infection at the treatment site.

During active skin disease.

For very large areas in which more than 3cc product is required then only a doctor can decide for it.
