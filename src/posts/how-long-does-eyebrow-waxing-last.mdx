  **How long does eyebrow waxing last?** Eyebrow waxing can last for up to 6
  weeks normally but it is recommended that you should get waxing after every 3
  to 4 weeks. Eyebrows play an important role to make you look beautiful and
  weird as well. Because when we look weird, we feel discouraged and our
  personality is not well-developed.

With eyebrow waxing, you can save a lot of time in plucking your eyebrows every day and spend it on doing other productive things for yourself. You will be surprised to know that running out of eyebrow pencils is something that happens often! Waxing is always a good choice to remove unwanted hairs from many other parts of the body like the upper lips, chin, and upper neck. It is a painless process that can be done at home or you can also go to salons for it.

## What should I choose, Eyebrow waxing or threading?

Threading is another process in which a thin, twisted thread is rolled over the skin to remove unwanted hair from the roots. Threading provides more control in shaping eyebrows than waxing.\
Waxing can be done at home or professional parlor so it is not very expensive either. Waxing lasts for 6 weeks (maximum) and you don’t have to do it too often.

Threading is a little painful but there is no need to go for threading again and again because waxing can be done after every four weeks which lasts much longer than threading.

Also, you should try to grow your eyebrows since it will help in distinguishing between different facial features and in making your face look beautiful after shaping eyebrows with waxing. Moreover, it is practically possible for you to grow eyebrows at home with proper care.

You should also try shaping your eyebrows yourself; once you gain expertise you can go for waxing every month and the results will be beautiful and wonderful!

## What to keep in mind when going for eyebrow waxing?

After you have finally decided that you need to get waxing for your eyebrow then you should keep the following things in mind.

### Be sure about what you are doing

The first thing is that you need to make sure that what kind of eyebrow shape you want. If you don’t decide your eyebrow shape beforehand, there is a chance that the waxing professional will not give you the desired look and you might end up looking weird.

After deciding what kind of eyebrow shape do you want then it is also important to know which waxing technique should be used for removing hair from eyebrows. Professionals can be trusted in giving you the right shape for eyebrows, but waxing is a process that can only be done by an expert.

### Don’t compromise with quality

There are so many salons that are providing waxing services but not all of them are proving super quality. You may need to pay some extra bucks for a quality waxing service. So never do a compromise with the quality and always go for a waxing service provider that provides you with premium services.

### Be sure of your skin type

It is also important to be aware of your skin type before going for a waxing session. Don’t go for a waxing treatment if you have sensitive or delicate skin because it can cause damage to the skin which will make things worse.

Research has proved that women with dark hair are more likely to be more affected by the waxing of eyebrow hairs. Waxing can remove up to three layers of skin which leaves your skin highly sensitive to sun exposure.

### You may also get a trim

Although you are going for waxing still some eyebrow artists may use a trimer to get rid of a few unwanted hairs. It is also possible that you might get a trim on your own so be sure about it before stepping out of the house for an eyebrow waxing session. So you need to keep in mind that it can happen so you don’t be surprised if your eyebrow lady trims a little bit of hair!

### Don’t over tweeze

Tweezing and waxing is the most common technique used by people to get rid of unwanted eyebrow hairs. It is important that you keep in mind not to do it too often otherwise it will damage the skin and might cause burning sensation, redness, and irritation. Also, your eyebrow hair might grow back thicker making it difficult for you to get the desired shape!

**[Threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threading_(epilation))** may be harmful in the case of sensitive skin so if you have sensitive skin then do not go for threading at all!

Waxing can remove hairs from the root which makes it clear from the start that hairs will not grow back until new hairs come out of the skin.

Waxing is also good because it can last for two weeks which is better than threading which lasts for only one week. Waxing may be painful but it does not lead to any injury in the long term so if you are up for some pain then go with waxing!

### You may feel pain

Keep in mind that during the whole process you are going to feel some pain. Some people feel really high pain while some may experience less but the truth is that it is not an easy job by any means. You need to keep in mind that the sugar waxing method causes more pain than the normal hard waxing method. So if you can’t bear even a little bit of pain then you should go for the conventional hard waxing method.

Waxing is also said to be safe because it does not lead to any kind of skin damage or rashes. However, there are some cases that have been reported where people experienced redness or itchiness after getting their eyebrows waxed which lasted for a few days only.

### Be honest with your eyebrow artist

Your eyebrow technician will ask you whether you have already got the treatment if it is your first time. If you have had the treatment done before then let your eyebrow expert know that so it can be better for both of you. You need to tell them how much hair you want them to remove during the waxing session because sometimes these professionals are unable to grasp what is desired by the customer!

### Your brow hairs will start growing after 5-10 days

Be ready to meet your new brow hairs right after the session because it is possible that you might see hair growing in a few days only.

So if you are going for eyebrow waxing for the first time then do not wear makeup on your brow area before going for treatment. Also, do not go under the sun before a waxing session as it will burn your skin and can also cause damage to your skin.

So remember that it is not a permanent solution and your brow hairs will start growing again but the good news is they won’t be as thick as before so you can get rid of them by waxing whenever you want!

### You may go for threading if needed

Threading is also a popular method used for eyebrow hair removal so you can try it out if waxing is not working for you. This method is widely used in the Middle East and South Asia but some people from the West also prefer threading to get desired eyebrow shape!

### Does waxing eyebrows cause sagging?

No, it does not cause sagging in the future but you need to keep in mind that it will lead to your brows getting thinner and lighter because the hair is removed from the root. So if you want thicker and darker eyebrows then go for a proper eyebrow threading session!

## Does threading last longer than waxing?

Eyebrow threading last for a shorter period because hairs begin to grow after 5-6 days so you need to visit the salon again unless you want a bushy look!

Threading is also said to be less painful than waxing but it is not true always. Waxing and threading both have their own pros and cons so you need to choose the one that seems better for you!\
So these are reasons why eyebrow waxing does last longer for a longer time. Threading may make your brows look thinner at times but it depends on the experience of your technician!

## Why does threading last longer than plucking?

Threading removes hair from the follicle, while **[plucking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plucking_(hair_removal))** removes hair from the surface of the skin. When hair is plucked, the follicle is damaged and can’t produce a new strand of hair as easily as it did before. This is why plucking often results in ingrown hairs. Threading, on the other hand, doesn’t damage the follicle and so hair can be removed more easily and without risk of ingrown hairs.

## Disadvantages of eyebrow threading

Below are the disadvantages of threading.

* Threading is not as effective on short hair or light-colored brows
* Threading can cause the removal of more eyebrow hairs than desired
* It can lead to some skin damage including redness, itching, and blisters, which may last for a few days
* Eyebrow threading lasts for a shorter period of time because hairs begin to grow after 5-6 days so you need to visit the salon again unless you want a bushy look

## Conclusion

In the end, now you know how long does eyebrow waxing last and what are the benefits that you can get from waxing. So thanks for reading and have a nice day.
