## How long does unemployment disqualification last?

<!--StartFragment-->

Unemployment disqualification lasts for three years from the mailing date. This means that disqualification is not indefinite. You will be disqualified for three years starting on the mailing date.\
As you can see, it is important to know what your mailing date is if you want to determine how long unemployment disqualification will last. If you still think that three years sound too much, let’s look at some of the most common questions regarding this topic.

## How long will my disqualification last after I am fired from my job so that I can receive unemployment?

Disqualification for being fired has a maximum duration of 6 months starting from the mailing date if you have been employed for at least 12 weeks in the last year. If you haven’t been employed for more than 12 weeks, the disqualification period will be shorter.

If you have been employed for at least 20 weeks in the last year and you were fired from a job, you will receive a disqualification of three years or until your unemployment benefit exhaustion date comes (whichever is sooner). This rule applies to every unemployed person for at least 12 weeks in the last year.

## If I was disqualified for unemployment benefits, can I apply again?

Suppose you have been disqualified for unemployment benefits but later find a job and work fewer than 15 hours each week or earn less than ½ of your weekly benefit amount in wages. In that case, you are probably eligible to receive unemployment.

## How to fix disqualified unemployment?

If you have been disqualified from unemployment benefits but still want to receive them, it is important to know that the only way to do so is by sending a request for reconsideration. In order to do that, you will need a compelling reason as to why you should be allowed back into the system and why the decision was wrong. It is a good idea to always consult a lawyer before filing this request, as you will have to provide evidence from your side.

## When is the best time to apply for unemployment?

If you are unemployed, you must file for unemployment as soon as possible after being fired or let go from your job. You can either file online at the state unemployment website or through your local unemployment office.

## How long do I have to be unemployed before I can file for unemployment?

Before you can apply for unemployment, you must meet three requirements:

* You must be unemployed.
* You must be able to work
* You must be ready, willing, and able to work

These conditions apply to every state in the U.S. If you meet all these requirements, you can file for unemployment.

## What is a disqualification period?

A disqualification period is a certain amount of time after which you will not receive unemployment benefits because you broke one or more rules while receiving benefits. These rules are usually related to the fact that you must be ready, willing, and able to work.

This means that you are looking for a job every week, have enough money saved not to have trouble paying your bills when no money is coming in, or decided not to take a job because it was too far away from home.

## What does it mean when your PUA says disqualified?

Your PUA or Personnel Underwriting Assistant will let you know that they disqualified your claim because of this particular reason and provide a link to the official state disqualification policy.\
The most common reasons for disqualifying unemployment benefits include:

* You did not apply for enough jobs/you didn’t go on interviews
* You refused two job offers
* You turned down a job because it was too far away from home
* You worked while receiving benefits

All of these reasons are related to the fact that you must be ready, willing, and able to work. This means that you can’t refuse jobs, even if they require skills you don’t have or pay is very low. You also can’t hold onto a job while you are unemployed, and finally, staying home all day without working is not an acceptable reason. If you do any of these things on purpose, this can be grounds for disqualification.

## What does it mean when your UEB says disqualified?

Your UEB or Unemployment Eligibility Benefit will let you know that they disqualified your claim because of this particular reason and provide a link to the official state disqualification policy.

## How long does EDD disqualification last?

The disqualification period for the **[EDD](https://www.edd.ca.gov/uibdg/Miscellaneous_MI_45_-_Reason_for_Decision.htm)** is usually one year. However, if you commit fraud or intend to do so, this can be extended up to three years! If you are disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits and later find work but earn less than half of your weekly benefit amount or work fewer than 15 hours each week, you may be able to get your benefits back.

If you are disqualified because you voluntarily quit your old job, this will not affect your unemployment benefits. To learn more about disqualification periods, visit the state unemployment website or refer to the official state disqualification policy.

## Conclusion

Unemployment benefits can be stopped if you break the rules, such as refusing jobs or quitting your job. This disqualification period is usually one year and may be extended to three years when fraud is involved.
