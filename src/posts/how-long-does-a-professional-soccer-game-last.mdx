## What is Extra Time Period in Soccer and How It Works?

There is a possibility that a soccer match ends with a tie. But what about when there is a world cup match, and it ends with a tie? This is not fair to leave the match tie, and no one wins, right? So how will the referee deal with this situation? Well, there is a way to solve this problem, and it is called extra time or added time.

An extra time is a term or rule when both teams end up with a tie match, and no one is declared a winner. So extra 30 minutes will allow to teams to play the match again and try to do a goal to win the match. However, if a team does a goal before the 30 minutes end up, the match will not stop until the 30 minutes pass.

If, after the extra time, it is still a tie match, then the match winner will be decided through the five best shootouts against the opponent’s goalkeeper.
