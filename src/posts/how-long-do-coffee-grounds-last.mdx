My morning can not be morning if I don’t have my cup of coffee. It wakes me up and gives me energy for the day ahead.

But I HATE throwing away my coffee grounds! So I decided to investigate **how long do coffee grounds last**. If you are like me, read on to find out how long you can keep your used coffee grounds before they go bad.

The first step is to check the date on the bottom of your coffee grounds bag. If there’s no expiration date, that means that the coffee beans are just recently ground up, and they should be fine to use. If there is an expiration date on your coffee bag, you’ll need to investigate further. Read more below!

## How long do coffee grounds last?

|                                 |                  |        |         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Coffee Ground                   | Pantry           | Fridge | Freezer |
| Ground Coffee (Unopened-Sealed) | Best before date | /      | /       |
| Ground Coffee (Opened)          | 3 Months         | 7 Days | 1 Year  |

An unopened coffee ground can last for 5 months while an opened coffee ground can last only 3 months.

After 3 months of being opened, your coffee grounds can last up to 7 days in the refrigerator.\
However, if you plan to use these coffee grounds for composting, you should use them within 1 week of opening the bag.

## How to tell when coffee grounds go bad?

If the coffee grounds are brown, then they’re still good to use. However, if the coffee grounds are greenish or yellowish in color, they have gone bad and should not be used.

## What does coffee ground smell like when it goes bad?

When your coffee grounds have gone bad, they will begin to emit a moldy smell. Coffee grounds that are not moldy should still be fine to use, but you might want to throw them out if they emit a strong smell.

## How do store them properly?

To store coffee grounds properly, you will need to keep them in an airtight container. This way, no moisture can get into the bag of coffee and ruin all your hard work!

Since coffee grounds are also highly absorbent, you should store them in a glass jar with a rubber seal. This will ensure that your coffee grounds stay fresh for as long as possible.

## How long does ground coffee last in the freezer?

Ground coffee will keep fresh for about a year in the freezer. However, if you plan to use your ground coffee within a few weeks, there is no need to freeze it.

## What to do with expired ground coffee?

You can still use expired coffee grounds for composting. However, the nutrients in the coffee beans will be significantly weaker, and they may take a longer time to break down and become fertilizer for your plants.

If you plan on using old coffee grounds as fertilizer, then mix them with younger coffee that hasn’t gone bad yet. This will ensure that you get the most nutrients from your coffee grounds!

## Can I use 10-year-old coffee beans?

Yes, you can still use 10-year-old coffee beans. However, the quality of your coffee will not be as good compared to using fresh coffee beans since ground coffee has lost its flavor over time.\
If you are trying to save money, then it’s best to buy fresh coffee beans instead of buying older ones that have gone bad.

## What about the freezer?

There is no need to freeze your coffee beans. Just make sure that you keep them in an airtight glass jar, so no moisture seeps into the bag. This way, it’ll last much longer!

## Is coffee good for your health?

The answer depends on what kind of coffee you’re drinking. Coffee is actually the number one source of **[antioxidants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant)** in the western diet.

These antioxidants are linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and liver cancer.\
But that doesn’t mean that all coffee is good for you! Instant coffee has almost no benefits for your health.

## What kind of coffee is good for you?

The answer depends on what you’re trying to achieve. If you need an energy kick, then black coffee will give you the caffeine that you want without any added flavorings or sugars. Alternatively, if weight loss is your goal, then maybe putting all those creams and sugars could put you off your diet!

However, if weight loss isn’t your goal, feel free to drink the coffee you love with all the cream and sugar you want. It’s still better than not drinking any coffee at all!

## Is caffeine bad for you?

Of course, moderation is always key! Any drug can be bad for you if you take it in excess. Caffeine has been linked to insomnia and heart problems in some people who drink too much coffee.\
However, according to a recent study by the Mayo Clinic, caffeine intake of up to 200mg does not seem to affect people’s heart health negatively.

This is about the same amount of caffeine in one cup of coffee or three cans of cola. So go ahead and enjoy your morning cup of Joe; it won’t hurt you!

## How do preserve the taste of coffee grounds?

If you are trying to preserve the taste of your coffee grounds, then make sure that you store them in an airtight glass jar with a rubber seal.

Always keep in mind that moisture is your coffee grounds’ worst enemy. This is because it takes the freshness out of the coffee grounds, completely ruining any flavor you want!

## What is composting?

Composting is the process of breaking down organic materials to recycle them into natural fertilizers for plants. Since coffee grounds are highly absorbent, they will break down very quickly and create fertile soil for your plants!

Ancient Chinese farmers originally used composting to give their crops the most beneficial soil possible. This way, their produce could grow to its full potential!

## Summary

Coffee is a tasty drink that can give you a much-needed energy boost in the morning or perk you up in the afternoon.

But did you know that coffee grounds can also be used as fertilizer for many plants? If stored in an airtight jar with a rubber seal, your coffee will stay fresh and flavorful for months!
