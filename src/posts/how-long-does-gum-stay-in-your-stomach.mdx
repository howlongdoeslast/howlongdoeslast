According to folklore, swallowed gum takes seven years to digest. However, this is not backed by scientific evidence. The stomach and intestines are very efficient at breaking down food, and most substances that are swallowed will pass through without issue. That said, there are a few exceptions where swallowed objects can cause problems. So **how long does gum stay in your stomach?**

Gum is made of a type of indigestible rubber called polyisobutylene. This means that it can’t be digested by the stomach technically. However, the stomach is very good at breaking down food, and most substances that are swallowed will pass through without issue.

In most cases, swallowed gum will simply pass through the digestive system and be eliminated in the feces. However, there are a few exceptions where swallowed objects can cause problems. For example, if a large piece of gum gets stuck in the throat, it could cause choking. Similarly, if a large piece of gum blocks the intestines, it could cause intestinal blockage.

## How long does gum stay in your stomach?

Gum stays in your system only for seven days or less. After that, it is usually expelled through the feces. There are rare cases of people swallowing gum and it staying in their intestines for a month or more, but that is not the norm.

The components of gum that make it difficult to digest are sugar and artificial sweeteners. Once these two ingredients are absorbed into the body, they start to break down and are eventually eliminated.

Most people pass gum within a week, but there have been cases of gum staying in the intestines for up to a month. If you are concerned about gum staying in your system for an extended period of time, you can always consult with a doctor.

## How does gum digest in our system?

Gum is generally digested in the small intestine. However, it can take up to one week for gum to be completely eliminated from the body. And, like any other food item, gum can get stuck in the gastrointestinal tract if you swallow too much of it at once.

## Here is how gum will digest in your system or stomach?

1. You chew and swallow the gum
2. It will go inside your esophagus and get to your stomach
3. Once in the stomach, the gum will start to break down
4. The digestive enzymes and gastric acids will work on the gum
5. The breaking-down process will release carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids
6. The small intestine will absorb these
7. The indigestible part of the gum (the cellulose) will travel down to the large intestine
8. Bacteria will break down the cellulose in the large intestine
9. This process will produce gas, which may cause bloating or flatulence
10. The indigestible part of the gum will be eliminated through the feces
11. It can take up to one week for the entire gum to be eliminated from the body

## Is swallowing gum hazardous?

Folklore suggests that swallowed gum stays in your stomach for seven years. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, the National Institute of Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) reports that gum will pass through your system like any other food.

However, a large amount of gum can cause intestinal blockages. Therefore, if you swallow large pieces of gum, it’s essential to monitor your stool. If you notice any changes in your stool or if you experience abdominal pain, contact a doctor.

In general, swallowing gum is safe. However, there are a few exceptions where swallowed objects can cause problems. For example, if a large piece of gum gets stuck in the throat, it could cause choking. Similarly, if a large piece of gum blocks the intestines, it could cause intestinal blockage.

If you are concerned about swallowing gum, you can always consult with a doctor.

## Where did the gum myth come from?

The myth that gum remains in your stomach for seven years likely originated from a misunderstanding of what happens to the gum as it passes through your digestive system. Gum comprises two components: the actual gum base and the sweeteners and flavorings. The gum base is made from elastomers, resins, **[waxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax)**, and oils, which give gum its chewy texture. The sweeteners and flavorings are what give gum its taste.

When you chew gum, your saliva breaks down the sweeteners and flavorings, but not the gum base. As a result, the gum base is indigestible and unchanged passes through your digestive system.

## Can swallowing gum cause stomach pain?

Folklore suggests that swallowed gum will stay in your stomach for seven years. But is this true?\
The answer is no. Gum is not harmful when swallowed and will pass through your digestive system like any other food. However, swallowing too much gum at once can cause constipation or gastrointestinal blockages.

So, the next time you accidentally swallow a piece of gum, don’t worry. It will not cause any long-term damage and will be eliminated from your body in a matter of days.

## Conclusion

There is no evidence that gum can stay in your stomach for seven years, and it is a pure myth. If you have swallowed the gum, it will get out of your body in just a few days without any pain and hurting.
