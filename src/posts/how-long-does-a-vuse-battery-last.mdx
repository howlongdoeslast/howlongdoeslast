## How long does a Vuse Alto battery last?

Vuse Alto comes with pretty decent battery life. The battery power is 350 mAh that can **last for 24 to 36 hours or 200 puffs**. However, there are other factors that can affect the battery life span as a number of puffs and other pod features.

There are many vapers who keep asking this question on forums and Quora, but there is no proper answer to it. However, we can make an assumption based on how long other similar batteries like JUUL’s last. So we can say that the battery lasts for more than 200 puffs.

## What are the factors that affect the battery life?

Let’s talk about some facts and figures that you should know:

* 1) The battery power of Vuse Alto is 350 mAh which is higher than JUUL.
* 2) One puff means taking a drag with your vape just once, so if you are smoking your vape more than once – it’s not one puff.
* 3) The battery life of Vuse Alto also depends on the temperature at which you are vaping at. Higher temperature requires more power.
* 4) To make the most out of your pod, use only 70% battery capacity before charging it back to 100%.
* 5) The average battery life of Vuse Alto is around 24 to 36 hours. However, you can’t expect it to give you this average battery life while vaping at the same time throughout the day.

## How long does a Vuse ePod battery last?

If we talk about the overall battery life, then it can last for one year. And if we talk about the one charge cycle, then the ePod battery can last for 190 puffs. That’s around the same as the Vuse Alto battery.

## How long does the Vuse Alto pod last?

The Vuse comes with two pods, and each pod is consists of 1.8 ml of liquid. The approximate life span of one 1.8 ml pod is three days or 500 puffs.\
So two cartages of 1.8 ml are enough for a regular smoker for six days.\
In case if you are a heavy smoker, then you should buy at least four pods for every purchase.\
The company gives a 30-day money-back guarantee on this product. So it is pretty safe to buy it and try it.

## How long does a Vuse battery take to charge?

The battery takes 2 hours to get fully charged. But it’s not a problem because you can use your vape while it is getting charged.

Vuse Alto comes with a USB charger, so you don’t have to worry about finding a wall adapter for charging. Simply connect your charger with any power source like a computer or mobile phone chargers.

## How many cigarettes is a Vuse cartridge equal to?

One pack of cigarettes is equaled to one cartage of Vuse pod. So if you are smoking 20 cigarettes per day, then the Vuse pod can last for four days.

## What is the average cost of a Vuse Pod?

The product price varies from state to state. But it is around $19 for one pack. However, if you buy it in bulk, then you will get better deals. So before buying it, you should check out the offers of your state.\
With that being said, I want to mention one thing it is not advisable to keep smoking cigarettes if you are vaping Vuse Alto. Because it is harmful to health, just like other chemicals released by a burning cigarette. So take care of your health and switch to herbal vaping.

## Conclusion

The Vuse Alto pod is a 500-puff refillable cartridge that comes with 350 mAh battery life. The average battery life of Vuse Pod is 200 to 250 puffs, which is impressive.\
So if you are looking for an E-cigarette with good battery life, then it can be the best choice for you. However, always keep in mind that regular charging is needed to keep its battery life long.
