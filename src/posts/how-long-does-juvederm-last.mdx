## What is Juvederm?

![How Long Does Juvederm Last](/img/juvederm-1-768x512.webp "How Long Does Juvederm Last")

Juvederm is basically a facial filler that can be used for lip augmentation, wrinkle reduction, certain types of scars treatment, and so on. It is made out of **[hyaluronic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronic_acid)**, which is famous for its consistency with water molecules.\
Hyaluronic acid has a high molecular weight which helps to avoid diffusion through the skin pores. It is safe, painless, and easy to use for this reason.

## How Long Does Juvederm Last?

As the product’s price depends on the amount of filler in it, you can expect that very cheap Juvederm will not last for more than six months, while high priced ones may last up to one year.

However, this may vary depending on your lifestyle and eating habits. If you eat junk food or oily foods, you will see Juvederm disappearing faster than usual. On the other hand, if you are careful with what to eat and drink, then chances are that your filler will last up to one year or even more.

## What is The Difference?

Different types of filler use different materials, and that’s why you will see differences in their longevity. For example, the oldest Hyaluronic acid fillers are gone now because their molecules were too big to penetrate deep within skin pores which mean they faded away very soon.

But newer “smaller” molecules of hyaluronic acid penetrate deep within skin pores and give you great results for a longer time.

## What’s the Best Way to Keep Your Filler Last Longer?

The best way to keep your filler last longer is to take care of it and use it only in the recommended amount (that means do not overfill your lips).

## What is Voluma?

Voluma is another filler product that is very famous nowadays. It was originally created for surgical augmentation of cheeks, cheekbones, and mouth area, but now people are using it for lip augmentation as well because it’s cheaper than Restylane or Juvederm.\
However, it contains an amount of lidocaine which can make you numb and prevent the feeling of pain during injection- that’s why it is very popular.

## What Makes Voluma Longer?

Voluma is made out of Hyaluronic acid, which has larger molecules than any other product on this market. Its molecules can penetrate deep within skin pores and thus last longer.

## How To Make Juvederm Last Longer?

There are a few precautions that you can consider taking if you are willing to enhance the lifespan of Juvederm.\
1- Make sure you are getting hyaluronic acid instead of silicone.\
2- Avoid foods that stimulate acid production in your body because acids will make the filler dissolve faster.\
3- Never overfill your lips or other areas where it is located. Fillers last longer when they stay in their original form and do not overstay.\
4- Do not smoke and avoid sun exposure to prevent aging.\
5- Avoid rubbing your face with dirty hands because it will damage the filler and make it more quickly come out of skin pores.

## How Long Does Juvederm Treatment Last in Clinic?

Juvederm treatment at a clinic is supposed to last up to half an hour, and it depends on the number of units you get, while some procedures like lip augmentation can be done in less than 10 minutes.\
It’s very easy and safe, and you don’t need any anesthesia (unless you want it).\
However, it’s always better to consult your doctor before getting started.

## How Long Does Juvederm Last If Used Alone?

If you are using Juvederm without any other product or injection, then the effects can last up to 6 months which is a pretty long time.\
However, not many doctors use it alone for lip augmentation. In most cases, they use it with hyaluronic acid or Radiesse, which is another filler that can last up to a year long.

## What is Hyaluronic Pen?

The **[hyaluronic pen](https://howlongdoeslast.info/hyaluron-pen/)** is another kind of filler that can last up to 18 months.\
It’s a pen-shaped device with small tips where you can inject minimal amounts of filler (0.3 ml) right into your skin pores.

The main advantage of this technique over the classic technique is that you don’t need any anesthesia.\
You can do it yourself at home as many times as you want. After all, the needle that Hyaluronic Pen uses is very small and thin – although you may feel a slight prick – it won’t hurt.

## What is the Difference between **[Botox](https://howlongdoeslast.info/botox/)** and Juvederm?

Botox is a neurotoxin which means it’s made out of proteins that prevent your skin from producing excess amounts of sweat and oils.\
So you can keep your Botox injections for about 3-6 months. Still, if you use Juvederm and other hyaluronic acid fillers (for example, Restylane), then the effects can last up to half a year (6 months) which is very long compared to Botox.

## How Long Does Juvederm Voluma Last?

Voluma is the newest edition to the list of fillers, and it promises long-lasting effects.\
The results can last up to 18 months if you treat your skin with Voluma only once, but if you combine it with Botox or another filler (like Juvederm), then you can double the longevity of your injections since they will act together and extend the longevity of each other.

## Conclusion

So, in conclusion, it’s better to ask your doctor or consult an experienced dermatological specialist before using any kind of filler to treat your lines and wrinkles.\
It’s better to be safe than sorry because the effects of fillers depend on many factors like skin type, age, etc.

Plus, do not forget physical exercise and eat healthy foods like vegetables and fruits to maintain skin elasticity.\
It’s not good to use fillers in the wrong places, for example, your lips, because they can become very swollen if you treat them with these injections the wrong way.
