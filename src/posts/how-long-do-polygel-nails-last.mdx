Polygala nails last up to three weeks before needing a replacement, which makes them the perfect solution for when you want your nails to look their best.

## What is Polygel?

Polygel is a type of artificial enhancement that is used to solve issues with your nails. It involves using acrylic materials, which are bonded together using special chemicals. These new enhancements are perfect for those who want their nails to stay strong and healthy or those looking to improve the look of their fingernails.

The nail enhancements that we use are non-toxic, and they do not contain any harsh chemicals. Because of this, you don’t need to worry about having your nails look artificial.

## Which one is better, Polygel or Acrylic?

### **Polygel**

When it comes to artificial enhancements, there are many options available. Polygel nails are thin and lightweight when applied, making them the perfect choice for those who want their nails to feel natural.   

Polygel nails also look more natural than acrylics because they don’t require any filing or buffing time after the application process is complete. You can completely avoid all of that hassle by choosing this type of enhancement product for your nails.

Polygel nails only need 20 minutes to set, and then you can go about your business as usual. They will typically last up to three weeks before needing a replacement.

### **Acrylic**

Acrylic enhancements are a bit thicker than Polygel nails. They also need to be filed and buffed, which can take up a lot of time that you might not have available.

You do have the option to use acrylics if you want a thicker enhancement product for your nails. Acrylic nails tend to last longer than Polygel enhancement products, which might benefit some people. However, they can also cause more damage to your nails than Polygel enhancements will.

The acrylic enhancement product is thicker than the Polygel solution, so it does require you to file and buff your nails before using them.

## How long do Acrylic Nails Last?

The average lifespan of acrylic nails is two weeks, but it can vary according to the quality of the nails.

## How long did Gel Nails Last?

Gel nails usually last about three weeks before they start to lift or break off.

## Why does Polygel Nails Keeps Popping Off?

Due to the nature of the Polygel nail enhancement solution, they will last up to three weeks before you need to worry about replacing them. However, there are some instances when your nails might pop off even if you have used the best quality enhancement product possible.

This can happen because you didn’t use enough adhesive power or because too much was used. You can avoid having your nails pop off by following the nail enhancement application process steps carefully and using only the amount of glue that we recommend.

* Wash your Nails Thoroughly: The very first step is to always wash your nails thoroughly to remove any oil and dirt from nails. Also, sock your nails with a towel to dry them properly.
* Use a Nail Primer: It is the best way to apply Polygel nail enhancement products. A primer aids in the smooth and even applications of your nails. It helps to increase adhesive power as well as the durability of nails. It also offers protection from scuffs and damage for up to two weeks. You can use a nail primer by applying one or two coats before you start with the Polygel nail enhancement application process.
* Do not Over File: after you have applied primer, file your nails with a nail file to curve and follow the natural shape of your nails. Ove filing will result in thinning out your Polygel nails, making them prone to coming off easily.
