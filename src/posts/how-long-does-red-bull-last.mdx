  Energy drinks are now becoming more common than ever. We are living so busy
  lives, so we need everything quickly. Red Bull is a popular brand with many
  selling points. ***How long does Red Bull last*** though?


  Firstly, I will break down what a typical can of red bull contains. It contains a blend of caffeine taurine and other B vitamins. On the back of the can, it will tell you how much caffeine is in there – generally 80mg. Compare this to an average cup of coffee with 95mg; it’s actually not that much!


  The other ingredients in the can are pretty much vitamins, so there won’t really get you high or give you energy straight away after your drink them. It will just help your body get back to normal if it’s lacking some things than others.


  So, we learn that red bull isn’t actually packed with caffeine – so why is it so popular? Well, this is because of something called “energy blend.” It contains some smaller amounts of caffeine as well as some other ingredients, such as taurine (an amino acid that has been shown to help improve blood flow and can be beneficial for people with diabetes).


  These smaller amounts of caffeine give you a little boost, but not enough to make you feel hyper or jittery. It’s just enough to help wake you up! As they say, “**[Red Bull Gives you Wings](https://www.redbull.com/)**,” so how long does that last?

## How Long Does Red Bull Last?

**One 8.4-ounce can last up to 3 hours.**

How long does Red Bull really last? Well, it all depends on the user, really. If you are a person who uses energy drinks often, then you will build up a tolerance. You will need to drink more and more every day to get that short boost of energy that everyone needs once in a while.

If you’re not an energy drink addict, then one can last you about 3 hours. So go ahead and have that morning coffee! I’d personally suggest having an energy drink when you’re feeling tired in the afternoon or in the evening when it’s time for your 2nd wind.

## What is Caffeine?

**Caffeine** is an organic compound found in many plants. It’s extremely common and can be found in **coffee**, tea, soft drinks, chocolate, etc. All of these products are very popular around the world.

Caffeine is believed to affect your body by crossing the blood-brain barrier, which allows it to work its magic on your central nervous system. This is the reason you feel more alert and focused after drinking coffee or an energy drink, as it stimulates your brain.

Caffeine can cause anxiety, insomnia, headaches, and dehydration in high doses, so it’s best to have no more than 300-400mg per day if you’re sensitive to big doses. Only one 8.4-ounce can of red bull contains 80mg, so you’re not likely to overdose on caffeine.

## What Happens to Your Body After Drinking Red Bull?

You might feel hyperactive or jittery after drinking red bull. This is just because of the caffeine in there, that’s all! It can last up to 3-5 hours, so you will need to use it occasionally if you have a day when you don’t want to fall asleep at your desk.

It also contains some B vitamins, which is why you might feel a little boost in your energy levels after drinking it. We all need and crave sugar and caffeine in some form or another when we’re tired, so I’d say it’s pretty normal to drink one when you’re feeling like this!

It will give you a nice pick-me-up though, so try having one when you really need it!

## Is Red Bull Bad for Health?

Not really. As I said before, only about 300-400mg of caffeine a day, and you should be fine! You shouldn’t consume it in excess as, like everything else – moderation is key! Also, this is obviously different for children and people with sensitivity to stimulants.

Just make sure you’re not drinking red bull every day, and you should be fine!

## How Red Bull Goes into Bloodstream?

Red bull is a drink that has high caffeine content. Caffeine enters the bloodstream and stimulates the central nervous system and brain, making you feel alert and awake. The energy boost comes from sugar and other ingredients like taurine etc.

These all enter the bloodstream and provide your body with an immediate energy boost – but not much more than a coffee or tea.

The caffeine will last for around 3-5 hours, so be sure to have an energy drink only when you really need it!

## Why do People Love Red Bull?

It’s a mixture of ingredients that give you a little boost every now and then. You might feel hyper after drinking one can, as caffeine affects your brain and central nervous system.

**[Sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar)** is another factor as this provides you with a burst of energy, so it’s normal to be more awake for a few hours after drinking one. It also contains vitamins like B12, which will give you that extra energy boost!

## Is there any Alcohol in Red Bull?

There is no alcohol in red bull. It’s just a drink that contains some caffeine and sugar, which will give you an energy boost for a few hours!
