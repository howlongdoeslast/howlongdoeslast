## How long is Spaghetti good for in the fridge?

![How Long Does Spaghetti Last in the Fridge](/img/how-long-does-spaghetti-last-450x300.jpg "How Long Does Spaghetti Last in the Fridge")

<!--StartFragment-->

Spaghetti can last up to five days in the refrigerator. I must note here that although pasta can last up to five days in the fridge, sour cream and yogurt should only be kept for three days at most. I’ll continue talking about how long Spaghetti lasts in the fridge below, but I’ll also tell you how long sour cream and yogurt can remain outside of a refrigerator.

### **Cooked Spaghetti Shelf Life**

According to the USDA, cooked Spaghetti can last in a refrigerator for up to four days.

### **Fresh Pasta Shelf Life**

According to the USDA, fresh pasta can last in a refrigerator for up to ten days.

### **Dry Pasta Shelf Life**

According to the USDA, dry Spaghetti can last in a dry pantry for up to two years.

You might be surprised that pasta lasts such a long time when it’s packaged and not refrigerated.

However, as any of us who’ve ever gone grocery shopping before know, pasta is usually thrown into coolers immediately after production. These coolers keep the Spaghetti at a temperature of roughly forty degrees Fahrenheit, which is cold enough to keep the pasta safe for consumption.

It’s important to note that you should never let your cooked pasta sit out for more than two hours as this could cause bacteria to grow on it, increasing its chance of spoilage and making it unsafe to eat.

## How to know if Spaghetti is bad?

There are a few factors that you can check for yourself to know if the Spaghetti is bad or rotten now. Here are the factors to need to pay attention to.

* **Slimy Texture:** The very first thing that you will notice in rotten or bad Spaghetti is its texture. If you feel that Spaghetti is not in its usual form and feels a little slimy, then the chances are higher that it might have gone bad. As Spaghetti can dry out faster, thus resulting in a very slimy texture because of moisture loss from the product.
* **Color Change:** Spaghetti has a specific color that should be maintained while storing them at the right temperature. So, find that Spaghetti has started to lose its color even before the use by date or there is a subtle change in Spaghetti’s color. There might be an issue with the storage process, which cannot be controlled by the manufacturer any longer. 
* **Bad Smell:** There is no smell of rotting food products, but still, if Spaghetti has a bad smell to it, then there is no doubt about the product being spoiled. But, there are times when good pasta can also have a different kind of smell to it, and that’s why you need to be quick with your judgment and use it as soon as possible.
* **Mold:** Another indicator that the Spaghetti might not be good for consumption is the presence of mold on it. Spaghetti is made up of flour and moisture, which can provide a suitable environment for the growth of molds. If you find that Spaghetti has started to grow mold over it, you should not eat it under any circumstances, increasing your chances of being sick exponentially.

## How to Store Spaghetti for a Long Time?

There are two simple and easy ways to store Spaghetti for a long time.

Either Refrigerate it, or the second one is to freeze the Spaghetti.

### **Shelf Life in Refrigerator**

If you keep your Spaghetti at a cool temperature between 45°F and 32°F, then it will last up to five days. But, if you keep it in a slightly warmer temperature which is around 40°F, then it might only be good for three days at best.

Shelf Life in Freezer

If you want to make the Spaghetti stay fresh for a long time without any issue, then the best way to do so is by keeping it in a freezer. If you want to store Spaghetti in a freezer, then make sure that it is wrapped properly and sealed so that there is no chance of any contamination or moisture loss while it stays inside the freezer.

If you plan to store your Spaghetti for months at the end in the freezer, you should be buying it in bulk as this will reduce the chances of Spaghetti getting spoiled for no reason.

## How do you cook Spaghetti?

The steps to cooking spaghetti are simple and straightforward. If you know how to cook pasta, you can use that knowledge to know how long Spaghetti lasts in the fridge as well.

**First Step:** You need to find a large pot where you can fit the Spaghetti and still have room left for boiling it. The next step is to add water, preferably cold water, as this will prevent the Spaghetti from sticking together while cooking it.

**Second Step:** Now take your Spaghetti and repeat the word “me-ta-bo-li-an” over and over again until you have it properly memorized. Then add the spaghetti to the boiling water and wait for it to cook.

In case there is a pack of instructions on how to properly cook your Spaghetti, then you should follow that as well, but just in case there isn’t, then all that I have mentioned above will get it done for you.

**The Final Step:** Once your Spaghetti is ready, drain off the water, get it out on a plate, and serve hot with some sauce or even butter if that’s what you prefer. Note: Spaghetti can also be incorporated into different recipes, such as spaghetti bolognese, making the food all the more delicious and mouthwatering.

If your Spaghetti is already packed without any holes, you can put the lid on tightly and if not, add some plastic wrap on top of the container so when you open it up in the future, your sauce won’t spill out.

Label the container with the date that you put your spaghetti sauce in the freezer, and then place this in a part of the freezer where there is minimal traffic to avoid contamination. By following these steps, you will keep your tomato paste good for 8 months.
