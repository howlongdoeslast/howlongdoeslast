beforebody: Bloating can occur during the ovulation period. This is caused by an
  increase in the amount of progesterone, a hormone responsible for preparing
  your uterine lining for possible implantation, and can cause smooth muscle to
  relax. This is why bloating will only occur during the ovulation period, which
  happens during the second half of your menstrual cycle (14th-22nd day).
  Bloating can be experienced by some women during their menstrual period, but
  this occurs before ovulation since there is already a high progesterone level.
  But **how long does ovulation bloating last?** You can find the detailed
  answer in this post.

## How long does ovulation bloating last?

<!--StartFragment-->

Bloating can last for three to seven days. It will not last long if the body can process it fast. The best way to deal with bloating is to eat less calorie-dense food and more green veggies, which are low in carbohydrates and high in fiber. Vegetables can also help you deal with bloating by keeping your digestive system healthy and letting your body have more efficient means of glucose extraction from the bloodstream.

## What are the possible causes?

There are several factors that can lead to an increase in progesterone, but the usual one is the ovulation period. This is why pregnant women will not experience bloating at all because progesterone level is high when a woman becomes pregnant. Luteal phase defect can also be responsible for increased progesterone level, which is the production of progesterone after ovulation period was shorter than normal. Luteal phase defect usually results in delayed menstruation.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome can also increase progesterone levels because there are high androgen levels present in the body, which causes an imbalance between estrogen and progesterone.

## Bloating Remedies

There is nothing to worry about bloating as it will go away on its own after a few days. However, you can still take some actions to make you feel better. Drink plenty of water and eat green vegetables, fruits, and food with soluble fiber to help deal with bloating faster. Be careful in choosing the kind of food that you want to eat since it is possible that certain food may trigger an increase in the level of progesterone. You can also try a warm bath to help you relax your muscles and feel better.

## How to stop bloating during ovulation?

Your diet is crucial to bloating since it is the main cause of bloating. If you have a healthy diet, it can help reduce bloating. You should eat food with high water-soluble fiber to get rid of excess estrogen, which will result in less progesterone production and therefore alleviate the symptoms of bloating.\
In addition to that, adding lots of vegetables and fruits rich in soluble fiber into your daily diet is another way to get rid of bloating, which can help balance estrogen levels in your body (you should avoid high potassium foods like bananas).

Foods that are known as **[high FODMAP](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-lowdown-on-the-low-fodmap-diet-2020072720662)**, which is fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides and polyols, can also increase bloating after having them. You should avoid foods high in FODMAPs if you want to prevent bloating.

## Do only pregnant women experience bloating during ovulation?

No, anyone can experience bloating during ovulation. Bloating during the ovulation period is not a serious condition and will only affect your body for about three to seven days. However, suppose you are experiencing constant bloating even when you do not have your menstruation or ovulation period. In that case, the cause may be a more serious one, and you should see your doctor.

## What are the causes of severe bloating during ovulation?

There are several causes of bloating during ovulation, like ovarian cysts. However, there will not be any serious health problems caused by bloating for only a few days each month.\
You should rest and relax as much as possible to help your body get rid of the bloated feeling faster, and you should avoid strenuous physical activity.

## Does Ovulation bloating cause weight gain?

Yes, some women who experience bloating during ovulation also gain weight. This is because having excess estrogen in the body can cause body fat to be stored in certain parts of your body, especially in your hips and thighs. Also, it is because of water retention caused by estrogen, which results in weight gain.

## What are the symptoms of ovulation bloating?

Below is the list of symptoms that will indicate ovulation bloating.

### Changes in cervical position

Changes in cervical position are one of the most common ovulation bloating symptoms. It can be seen when your cervix will lower after ovulation occurs, which will make you feel bloated in your abdomen.

### Abdomen bloating

When there are changes in estrogen level in your body which causes an increase during the time of ovulation, it may cause the swelling of your abdomen, which makes you feel bloated.

### Intestinal bloating

Your intestines will release gasses from the fermentation of foods during the time of ovulation if there is a high estrogen level in your body, causing intestinal bloating.

### Patches of darkened skin

Some women experience the darkening of their skin, particularly around the abdomen, thighs, and underarms during ovulation. This darkening is usually the result of a change in estrogen level in your body, which causes an increase after ovulation.

## Conclusion

Once you have reached menopause, bloating will not occur again when ovarian function comes to a stop. However, if you are still of menstrual age, the ovarian function can be back to normal after menstruation.
