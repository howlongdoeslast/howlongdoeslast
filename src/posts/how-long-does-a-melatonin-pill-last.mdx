## How long does a melatonin pill last in your system?

**Melatonin can stay in your system for up to six to eight hours**. The half-life of Melatonin is 30 to 60 minutes. The hormone does not remain in the bloodstream because it is quickly metabolized.\
In this way, those who take a small amount of Melatonin may cause a long-term effect on the body as Melatonin levels build up and down for several hours. This could lead to disrupted sleep for some people.

## What Is Melatonin?

Melatonin is a hormone that your body releases on its own to regulate the circadian rhythm. It also helps with other sleep, metabolism, and sex drive functions. Melatonin can be made synthetically, which means you can ingest Melatonin through supplements or medications of the synthetic kind.

The pineal gland produces Melatonin, and when melatonin levels rise in the evening or at night, it makes you feel tired and ready for sleep. When melatonin levels fall again in the early morning, your body is ready to wake up.

## Does Melatonin helps to sleep better?

It is believed that taking the synthetic form of the hormone will help people with sleep disorders sleep better, but there are no long-term studies to prove this. It is best to take low doses to minimize any risk for adverse effects.

However, Melatonin also has its drawbacks; it can negatively affect your health if you take too much of it. It can decrease your sex drive, and it is not recommended if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, as there have been no studies conducted yet that show what the effects on the baby might be.

## How does our body produce Melatonin?

The **[suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546664/)** of the hypothalamus releases a hormone known as Melatonin. It is produced in a small gland located near the brain called the pineal gland. Once released, this hormone enters into the bloodstream and works all over the body to regulate the sleep-wake cycle.\
In normal conditions, it reaches its peak level between 10 pm and 2 am, that’s why many people take it before they go to bed.

Once consumed, Melatonin is believed to help improve the quality of sleep by inducing drowsiness and lowering the time needed to fall asleep. However, scientists are still not sure whether this hormone has any role in normal adults or not.

## How Melatonin falls you asleep?

Melatonin kicks in your bloodstream and starts to lower your body temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. It helps to relieve anxiety and depression, which often prevent sleep from happening.\
Melatonin is a hormone that exists in your body naturally, created by the pineal gland (a tiny gland inside your brain) and released when it’s dark outside called dim light melatonin onset (DLMO).

When you’re exposed to sunlight (or bright lights at night), this triggers your brain to stop producing Melatonin.

In the brain, Melatonin acts as a chemical messenger that is involved in setting your body clock and initiating sleep. In people with insomnia, melatonin levels may be low as the darkness promotes its secretion at night, which is why it works for most people who have trouble sleeping.

## What happens if you take Melatonin too late?

The effect of Melatonin is felt 15 minutes after consumption, but it may also last for 4-6 hours, so if you take the supplement before sleeping when already time to wake up, it will not help you much in the morning. But still, there are not enough studies that show what happens if it is taken regularly for a long time.\
In addition, if you take the supplement too late in the evening, say an hour before bedtime, it may affect your sleep quality as sunlight turns off this hormone and makes you feel more awake before going to bed.

## Can Melatonin make you tired the next day?

Yes, you may feel tired, dizzy, and have a decreased mental sharpness the next day after taking Melatonin. It is believed that this effect may be due to the sleep-inducing properties of the hormone, which makes your body want to remain in a state of drowsiness and sluggishness while it is trying to make you feel more awake.\
Many users report feeling tired or serious and having emotional swings. When you stop taking it, your body can experience withdrawal symptoms that include vivid dreams and not feeling refreshed in the morning.\
Sleep aids such as Melatonin are often used for jet lag and adjusting to a new time zone. However, scientists say there is no proof that taking these sleep aids helps with this type of fatigue.

## How can you increase your natural melatonin production?

It is best that you increase the natural production of Melatonin in your system. There are some tips that you can follow to improve your sleep quality.

### Exposure to Sun Shine

Increase your exposure to bright light during the day, as this will help you decrease the time you need for it at night.

### Don’t Sleep with Lights On

Turn off the lights in your bedroom and try to sleep in darkness. This will help you increase melatonin levels at night time.

### Reduce Blue Light

Avoid watching TV or using mobile phones two hours before going to bed because they produce a blue light that can interfere with your natural production of Melatonin.

## Conclusion

Know you are aware of how long it takes for Melatonin to kick in your system so you can make appropriate choices regarding its timing. In addition, there are many other things that you may do to boost your melatonin production naturally. Having a healthy sleep schedule is important for everyone, and it will help you get more benefits from this hormone.
