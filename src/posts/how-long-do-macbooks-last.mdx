beforebody: MacBooks are great computers, but they will wear out over time, just
  like any technology humans have created. At this point in modern computing
  life, MacBooks should last between five to seven years if properly taken care
  of. This information is based on first-hand experience with the first MacBook
  Pro I bought in 2013 after graduating college. The computer is still working,
  but it’s extremely slow, and running the latest macOS version will be nearly
  impossible. The battery also only lasts about ten minutes on a full charge
  (but that’s an unrelated problem).

## What is a MacBook?

There are three different lines of MacBook computers manufactured by **[Apple](https://www.apple.com/)**. The MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro (without a Touch Bar), and the MacBook Pro (with a Touch Bar). All three sub-variants include processors with either 8 or 16 GB of RAM and storage sizes ranging from 128 to 1 TB. The only difference between these products is what’s under the hood and whether or not they have a Touch Bar.

## How long do MacBooks last?

This all depends on how much you use your computer and if it is treated with care, but most Apple laptops will stop working between 5 to 7 years after the date of purchase. In my case, I am projecting six years since my computer was purchased in 2013.

For most people using a MacBook, the computer will start to lag around the five-year mark depending on how much they use it and if it is stored in a dry area. Some computer scientists at UC Berkeley found that heat is one of the biggest factors when a laptop starts slowing down. The data collected from thousands of laptops suggests that these machines stop working once the internal temperature reaches about 116 degrees Fahrenheit (47 Celsius).

## How to make a MacBook last longer?

The first thing you should always do is backup your computer. Backing up a computer will save all of your data, programs, and settings so you can recover it if anything happens. The best way to back up your computer is to have an external hard drive connected to your MacBook with a USB cable. Having an extra copy of all of your data is extremely important if the MacBook crashes, the files go missing, or get damaged.

Another thing you can do to make it last longer is buying a cooling pad for your laptop, so it doesn’t get hot while you use it. This will also allow the computer to run a lot more efficiently and prevent some of the lag time while using your MacBook. You can buy a cooling pad for under $20 at most electronic stores like BestBuy or Amazon.

MacBooks are built to last, but all technology degrades over time, so just be aware that your MacBook might stop working one day. Also, never leave your computer at a super high or super low temperature because it can damage the battery life and slow down the internal components over time.

It’s also worth mentioning that some of this information is more relevant for desktop computers rather than portable laptops. Even though the standard warranty is only one year, Apple is still considered to be one of the best computer companies in the world. If you have any questions or concerns about your computer, feel free to contact an Apple specialist. They have a 24/7 hotline that will take care of all of your issues at no cost!

## What is the Expiry Period of All Models of MacBook?

The MacBook Air is due to expire after 7 years. If you have a late version of this laptop, it should be working well for at least 5-6 years. You can even eke out more work from it by carrying out a few simple upgrades.

The reliable and sturdy MacBook Pro family has laptops that are set to expire after 5 years. This is for all the models of MacBook Pro in the market right now – be it one with or without a touchscreen. But, some excellent machines in this series might last beyond the standard warranty term. The 2016 MacBook Pro 13″ base model, for example, can easily go past 6-7 years before giving up the ghost.

For the Apple MacBook Air, there is no concrete expiry date since it has been replaced so many times in such a short span of time. But if it is the range released between 2015 and 2017, you can expect it to work well beyond 5 years from now. Though this notebook does not have fancy features like touchscreen support, it is still a very reliable machine and will give you years of great service.

The entry-level models of the MacBook Pro should serve you well for at least five years. This means that if you buy one in 2018, by 2023, it should be working perfectly fine and may even get an upgrade to the latest macOS version. The same goes for the 13-inch MacBook Air, which was launched in 2015. This computer will serve you well till 2020, easily.

The Apple MacBook Pro 2017 base model with function keys is set to expire after 5 years since it was released not too long ago. You can always go past this warranty period by a few years if you take good care of the computer. It has an impressive hardware configuration and can easily withstand years of continuous usage.

The Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar will expire after 5 years since release. But, this laptop has high-end specs that are suitable for running the latest applications without any compromise on performance or speed. Thus, you can keep using it for years together without upgrading it.

The Apple MacBook Pro 2018 model with a function key strip will last for 6 years. This is a very impressive machine in all respects, but the only downside here might be the lack of legacy ports. But, when you have so many other useful features at your disposal, this drawback does not really matter and should not stop you from buying this wonderful laptop.

## How Long Does a MacBook Battery Last?

The life span of the MacBook battery strongly depends on the charging cycle count. Apple said they designed the battery to deliver the 1000 recharge cycles. After that, battery health started to decrease.

One charging cycle is defined as if you charge your MacBook’s battery to 100% and then unplug the charger. Now start using your MacBook and consume all the battery to 0% and then again recharge it to 100%; this whole process will count as one cycle.

So, ideally, the MacBook battery should last for 1000 charging cycles.

According to Apple’s official statement, the average lifespan of its flagship notebook is 5 years. But this warranty term can be extended up to 10 years if users take good care of their MacBook. This means that you need to charge your laptop correctly (to 80% only) and also try to keep it away from extreme heat or cold.

## What Factors make MacBook Disorder?

The main reason for MacBook disorder is CoreStorage volume. CoreStorage volume contains logical drives, which need to be removed via Disk Utility before reinstalling OS X.

For example, suppose you upgraded your hard disk or SSD to a larger size and formatted it as CoreStorage volume using Disk Utility. In that case, the CoreStorage volume will not be automatically enlarged when you replace the hard disk with a larger one. Therefore, your Mac doesn’t recognize the CoreStorage volume and thus causes MacBook disorder.

To fix this problem, you can use free 4u$ hug for Mac data recovery software to recover photos from Mac hard drive (including external USB HDD). And then connect it with another Mac computer and use Disk Utility to fix CoreStorage volume.

Apple has yet to release a new version of the MacBook Air in 2021, which means that you can still buy one of these notebooks with confidence if you are looking for an affordable laptop that will perform great and last long. Intel’s Broadwell U processors power the 13-inch variant with 2 GB of RAM, have a 13.3-inch LED-backlit display with a 1440 x 900 resolution and 128 GB of internal storage.

## Why My MacBook is Slow?

Incompatible hardware or software may cause MacBook disorder. Also, there are many system files stored in the Mac hard drive that take up a portion of the disk space and reduce overall computer speed.

On the other hand, there could be not enough free memory to accommodate new applications and thus making your MacBook slow. This is a common problem that mostly occurs due to insufficient RAM. You can free up the memory by restarting your MacBook and then closing all applications running in the background to fix this problem.

If your MacBook is slowed down due to malware or virus attacks, you should switch over to a professional antivirus program such as 4u$ hug for Mac malware removal. It can thoroughly scan your Mac and remove all threats from the system.
