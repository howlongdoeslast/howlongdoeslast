What else could be better than to wake up every day early in the morning and have a glass of fresh orange juice? It is not only healthy but also refreshing. You can buy oranges almost everywhere and they last for a while. But how long exactly do oranges last?

The answer to this question depends on different factors. Oranges that are stored at a temperature below 50 degrees Fahrenheit will last the longest. They can last up to two months. However, if you store them at a higher temperature, they will not last as long. For example, if you store them at room temperature, they will only last for about one week. So before we dive into **how long do oranges last**, let’s take a closer look at what determines their shelf life.

The main factors that determine **how long oranges last** are: the variety of oranges, the climate where they are grown, and the time of year they are picked. The most common type of orange is the Valencia orange. These oranges can last up to three weeks when stored at room temperature. However, if they are stored in a cooler environment, they can last up to six weeks.

Oranges that are grown in warm climates, such as Florida, will not last as long as oranges that are grown in colder climates. And oranges that are picked in the winter will last longer than oranges that are picked in the summer.
