  Wasp is in the same family as yellow jackets and hornets, and they all use
  pheromones to communicate with other wasps. Wasp pheromone is a series of
  chemicals that indicate such things as whether an area has been already
  claimed by another wasp (through marking) or if there’s prey waiting to be
  caught. A wasp’s pheromones also tell other wasps that their nest is being
  threatened or harassed, after which they may attack.


  Wasp pheromone only differs by the type of chemical that it reacts to, so there are two main types of insecticides used against them: chemicals that affect the nervous system and chemicals that affect the glands.


  **How long does wasp pheromone last?** Since wasps are insects, their exoskeleton breaks down quickly, which means that insecticide effective against insects may be very short-lived as well. Read on.

## How long does wasp pheromone last?

![How long does wasp pheromone last?](/img/how-long-does-wasp-pheromone-last-2-300x169.jpg "How long does wasp pheromone last?")

The lifespan of wasp pheromone is best measured by the life span of the individual wasps in question. It can range from a few hours to several weeks when an insecticide is used, but wasps are likely to die within just a week when it’s left untreated.

An effective dose of insecticides against insects can kill several wasps at a time. This, of course, depends on the effectiveness and application method of said chemical. For example:

An aerosol can is used to attack flying insects, so it’s only useful against them until they land again — which won’t be for long because they’re dead. A dusting powder will last longer than an aerosol because it doesn’t disperse in the same manner, but insects which come into contact with it will still be dead.

A concentrated chemical can last a bit longer since the dose is higher, and wasps may not want to fly close enough to get their antennas in contact with each other, reducing cross-contamination.\
In general: the higher the chemical concentration, the faster it will degrade.

Insecticides against insects also have a short life span by nature. They tend to biodegrade rather quickly, and it’s common for them to become useless after just a couple of days or weeks. This is not always true, but this is typically the case for most products.

## How do you neutralize wasp pheromones?

Baking soda and traps are the best ways to deal with wasps. You can mix baking soda in vinegar or keep a small trap near the nest and pour some bait inside it every so often.

Wasps will carry this mixture back to their nest, where it’s processed and turned into one of several things: food for larvae and adults, building and strengthening the nest walls, and so on.

If you don’t want to bother with mixes or traps, you could simply spray a mix of soap and water near the nest since wasps won’t fly in it for at least an hour, which should be long enough to kill any wasp that does fly through it. This method is more effective if you don’t have a nest but rather an established line of wasps moving through the area.

## Do wasps come back for revenge?

Wasps are more likely to attack if they feel that their nest is in danger, but only the ones who actually see you doing it. Wasps communicate with other wasps through pheromones, so if another one attacks first, they’ll get confused about what’s going on and why. This can also happen between two wasps of the same species but from two different nests, leading to fights between the two.

In general: wasps are more likely to attack if their nest is in danger since they have a lot at stake, and in most cases, protecting a few dozen larvae and a mass of food in the form of live prey or sugar-water will be more important to them than attacking a single person.

Wasps have better memories than humans, but not by much. Because of the way they behave and move around (their small size allows them to reach places that we can’t), it’s easier for us to remember the locations of their nests rather than individual wasps or interactions with those insects.

## What happens if you kill a wasp in your house?

Killing wasps in your house will lead to at most a stinging sensation if they have a nest inside. You can treat this by using baking soda and vinegar or heat their nest so that the larvae die, but only if you know where it is.

If you don’t know where the wasp’s nest is, these insects may not return to the same place again since they’ll be looking for a new one. You can use this method if you want to get rid of any wasps who are flying inside the house — but you will have to deal with their corpses yourself; otherwise, they may attract other insects, especially flies.

If you’re worried about your pets being stung, you can use the baking soda and vinegar method. It’ll neutralize wasps, but it won’t kill them right away. They may still try to sting your dog or cat, but they won’t be able to do anything since their stinger won’t work anymore.

**Tips & warnings**

* If you’re concerned about getting stung, you should stay away from wasps for the most part. Stings are typically not deadly, but they can be quite painful, and it’s best to avoid them entirely.
* If you want to kill wasps or have a nest inside your house, first use baking soda and vinegar to neutralize them so they won’t attack later on. Use traps to keep their numbers low for at least a few weeks when they return.
* If you have pets, be wary of any methods that can kill wasps. It’s best to use baking soda and vinegar or heat to neutralize them so that they don’t get killed when you try to deal with the nest.

## Conclusion

Wasps live in societies where there is a queen and dozens of workers. They use pheromones to communicate with each other, warn against danger and navigate when they’re flying or looking for food.\
They can kill most human beings if they feel that their nest is being threatened. Wasps will often act aggressively towards people around them, so it’s best to stay away from wasps if you can.
