## How long does cream cheese last?

* **Unopened:** 10 days in the refrigerator

You can use unopened cream cheese after 1 month of best by date. Once it is opened, it will last for 10 days in the fridge. If you freeze cream cheese, it can last for up to 2 months.

## How to store cream cheese?

Cream cheese is a dairy product just like **[buttermilk](https://howlongdoeslast.info/buttermilk/)** and **[yogurt](https://howlongdoeslast.info/greek-yogurt/)** so it will require the same preserving methods to keep it fresh and edible.

Place the cream cheese in a container or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Make sure that all of the air is squeezed out before putting it in the fridge. This will prevent bacteria growth and keep your cream cheese tasting fresh for up to 10 days. If you don’t plan on using all of the cream cheese within 10 days, then I suggest freezing it for later. Just make sure to thaw it out in the fridge before using.

However, if you are using Philadelphia cream cheese as a spread on bread then always use a clean spoon or knife to avoid contaminating the cream cheese with bacteria from your mouth. And finally, never eat cream cheese that has been out of the fridge for more than 2 hours. It is not safe to eat after that amount of time.

## Can I freeze the cream cheese?

Yes, you can freeze cream cheese. Just make sure to thaw it out in the fridge before using. I usually like to freeze it in 1 or 2 cup portions so that I have it on hand when I need it. It will last for up to 2 months in the freezer.

## How to tell if the cream cheese is bad?

Cream cheese is a dairy product so it can go bad if not stored properly. If you see any mold on the surface of the cream cheese, then it is not safe to eat and should be thrown away. There are some signs that will tell you that the cream cheese has expired. So let’s have a look.

* **Smell:** If the cream cheese smells sour or rank, then it is not safe to eat.
* **Taste:** If the cream cheese tastes sour or off, then it is expired and should not be consumed.
* **Texture:** If the cream cheese has an off texture, such as being watery or slimy, then it is expired and you should not eat it.

If you are unsure about the condition of the cream cheese, then I suggest discarding it and buying a new pack. It is not worth taking the risk of eating expired cream cheese. It could make you sick.

## How long does cream cheese frosting last?

Cream cheese frosting will last in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Just make sure to thaw it out in the fridge before using.

## Conclusion

To sum up, cream cheese is a type of cheese that has a soft and smooth texture. It is made from cow’s milk and has a high-fat content. Cream cheese generally lasts for two to four weeks in the fridge. However, it is important to check the expiration date on the package before eating it. If cream cheese is left out at room temperature, it will start to spoil within two hours. So, if you have any cream cheese that is close to the expiration date, it is best to eat it sooner rather than later. Enjoy!
