  If you have ever visited a dentist, then you probably have a dose of Novocain.
  And if you are just coming back from the dentist and want to know ***how long
  does Novocaine last***, you can check it on this website.\

  Novocain is a medicine that doctors use to make you numb. It is called local anesthesia because it just numbs the area where you inject the drug. It’s actually made from formaldehyde and cocaine. Yeah, that’s right, cocaine! The cocaine gets removed, but this anesthesia still makes your jaw numb for about an hour or so.

## How Long Does Novocaine Last?

Novocain can last up to two hours. It only lasts for an hour if you use it in your neck muscles. It can work up to 4 hours in your masseter muscle which is the muscle that moves the jaw or clenches down on things. That’s why dentists don’t put it there, because they need to move your jaw around.

## What is Novocain?

![How Long Does Novocaine Last?](/img/novocaine-1-450x300.webp "How Long Does Novocaine Last?")

Novocain is the brand name for a drug called **[procaine hydrochloride](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Procaine-hydrochloride)**. It is an anesthetic that works by blocking nerve signals in your body. It does this by eliminating the ability of your nerve endings to respond to stimulation or pressure.

## What Does Novocain Do?

It numbs the location of the injection so you don’t feel pain. It also decreases your heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure, making you less likely to move around during the surgery. Some people say that it causes them to feel cold or hot, but mostly everyone thinks of Novocain as a painkiller.

## Why Does Novocain Only Last Up To 2 Hours?

It only lasts up to 2 hours because the half-life of Novocain in your system is about an hour. The half-life is how long it takes for half of the drug to be eliminated from your body. So after an hour, there’s only 25% left in your body, and this continues until all of it has been eliminated from your body.

## What are the Factors that Last the Novocain?

The amount of Novocain that can last in your system depends on how the medicine is entered into the body. If it’s injected, it takes a shorter time to get eliminated from the body than if it’s applied topically. Also, genetics and other biological factors can affect how long Novocain lasts. For example, how fat a person is, what other medicines they take, liver health, and kidneys all play a role in the length of the Novocain effect.

In conclusion, if you have been to your dentist recently and can’t believe it’s been 2 hours since you felt pain, then just go home and rest to let the Novocain wear off. You can enjoy your day without pain and worry about what will happen the next time you come back to see your dentist!

## What are Types of Anesthesia?

Types of anesthesia include:

* General Anesthesia
* Local Anesthesia

General anesthesia is a combination of intravenous drugs and inhaled gases. The dosage of these drugs can be adjusted to induce loss of consciousness, so the patient does not feel pain in the muscles and joints or just loss of sensation when under general anesthesia. Patients need this anesthesia to be asleep and unconscious during the surgery because it is very risky for them to receive painkillers.

Local anesthesia blocks sensation in a specific area (it could be the mouth, throat, or any other part of your body). It can be injected or sprayed onto tiny areas. You may feel some irritation on your skin when this is happening, but you won’t notice a thing most of the time. It is not a painkiller, and it does nothing to prevent pain from the surgery itself.

## What are Local Anesthesia Side Effects?

Some side effects include – Mild nausea or vomiting – Headache – Numbness in your throat that lasts around 2 to 4 hours.

* **Mild nausea or vomiting:** the doctor may prescribe medicine for this. If you feel nauseated, take these meds right before surgery, and you should be fine.
* **Headache:** again, the doctor may prescribe some painkillers such as ibuprofen to help with your headache. Be sure to follow the doctor’s orders.
* **Numbness in your throat:** the numbness usually disappears within 2 hours of surgery, but sometimes you can still feel some pressure or tightness in your throat even after the anesthesia has worn off. Just be extra careful when swallowing food for a few days after surgery because things could get stuck easily!

## Conclusion

So now you know what Novocain is and how it works, so don’t be scared of needles anymore! Knowing the timetable for the medicine to wear off will answer some questions about when you can go back to your normal daily tasks.
