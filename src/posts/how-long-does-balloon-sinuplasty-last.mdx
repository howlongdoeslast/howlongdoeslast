## How long does balloon sinuplasty last?

A balloon sinuplasty lasts for at least two years. Studies have shown that the procedure can be successful for up to three years. However, some people may need to have the procedure repeated after a few years.

## How to perform balloon sinuplasty?

A balloon sinuplasty procedure is typically performed in an outpatient setting and lasts for around 4 hours. The patient is usually sedated, and a local anesthetic is used to numb the nose. A small incision is then made in the nose, and a guidewire is inserted into the sinus cavity. A deflated balloon is then passed over the guidewire and into the sinus cavity. Once in place, the balloon is inflated, which opens up the sinus passage. The balloon is then deflated and removed from the nose.

## How long does balloon sinuplasty take?

The whole procedure usually takes around 2 to 4 hours. However, the ballooning of the sinuses itself only takes a few minutes. You will be under anesthesia for the duration of the procedure. After the procedure is complete, you will be taken to a recovery room, where you will be monitored for a short period of time. Once you are discharged, you will need to take it easy for the next few days. Most people feel better within a week after the surgery.

## Does balloon sinuplasty hurt?

Yes, but it is not as painful as some of the other sinus surgeries. Due to gentle penetration of the sinus cavities, most people report only mild discomfort.

## Is balloon sinuplasty permanent?

Most people are curious about how long a procedure will last. With balloon sinuplasty, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that the results of the procedure are permanent. The bad news is that the procedure is not reversible. Once the balloons have been removed, the opening they created will be permanent.

## How long does bleeding last after balloon sinuplasty?

Bleeding is usually very minimal after a balloon sinuplasty procedure. In most cases, just a small amount of blood seeps from the **[nose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose)** for a day or two after the surgery. Rarely, more significant bleeding may occur, which can be controlled by nasal packing. It is important to keep your head elevated for the first few days following the surgery to minimize any swelling and bleeding.

## How long does sinus drainage last after balloon sinuplasty?

Most people experience a significant decrease in drainage within the first week after surgery. However, it can take several weeks for all of the drainages to subside. Therefore, you may notice a small amount of drainage for several weeks to months after the procedure.

## When can I return to work or school after balloon sinuplasty?

Most people are able to return to work or school within a few days of the procedure. However, you may need to take it easy for the first week or so while you recover.

## Final Thoughts

The long-term success of balloon sinuplasty is still being studied. Some early studies indicate that the procedure may be effective for up to five years. However, additional research is needed to confirm this. Most surgeons believe that the procedure is safe and effective for at least three years. If you are considering balloon sinuplasty, be sure to discuss the potential risks and benefits with your surgeon.
