In the fridge, **Greek yogurt can last for 3 weeks**. If you store it in the freezer, then it can last for 2 months. Greek yogurt is a dairy product, a variant of which is called strained yogurt.

## How does yogurt form?

There are two types of cultures that can be used to make yogurt: thermophilic and mesophilic cultures. Thermophilic is the one that produces yogurt made from **[milk](https://howlongdoeslast.info/buttermilk/)** with high-fat content. In Greece, they mainly use this type of culture for their yogurt.

## Can other cultures be used to make Greek yogurt?

In theory, you can use any type of culture to make Greek yogurt. But in practice, it doesn’t turn out the same, and the taste is very different from traditional Greek yogurt. Moreover, there might be health risks associated with using other than thermophilic cultures, so it is best to use the original type.

## What’s the science behind it?

When you add culture to milk, two different things happen: coagulation and fermentation. Coagulation occurs when the culture starts consuming lactose in milk and converting it into lactic acid, which eventually changes the structure of milk proteins.

The end product is a protein mesh, which traps the water and milk sugars. The fermentation process changes lactose in milk into lactic acid, increasing the acidity of yogurt. And if we add to that the fact that calcium acts as an inhibitor of enzymatic activity, then you get Greek yogurt with its typical thick texture.

## History of Greek Yogurt

Greek yogurt has been around since about 4000 BC when herders regularly rotate their herds across high mountain pastures. They didn’t realize that since the animals were always eating new grass and plants, their milk never had a chance to be fermented.

This changed once the Greeks started using the skins of nomadic tribes as wrappings for cheese and butter instead of as clothes or blankets. Trapped by these forms of packaging, cultures were created that were then mixed with milk, creating new forms of yogurt.

As the centuries went on, Greek yogurt became more popular and was eventually adopted by Central Asia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia… even the Turks have a version of this strained yogurt.

Today Greek yogurt has become one of the most popular yogurts in America and throughout the world. Stores like Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods Market, and Publix even have their own Greek yogurt brands right by regular yogurts in their refrigerated sections.

## How to tell if Greek yogurt has gone bad?

Bacteria grow in yogurt containing milk and sugar, which are perfect nutrients for the bacteria to thrive. This means that you should take Greek yogurt out of the fridge an hour before eating it, so the bacteria have less time to grow. The best way to tell if your yogurt is still good or not is by smelling it.

If it smells completely fine, then go ahead and enjoy it. However, if the smell is strange or too sour to stomach, then you should throw it out. You can also look at the yogurt for mold, as this is a good indicator that bacteria have been growing inside of it.

## How to store Greek yogurt properly?

Greek yogurt is best kept inside the refrigerator in its original container. If you plan to use it up in a couple of days, then feel free to put it in an airtight container and store it in your fridge. However, if you think that Greek yogurt will last longer than this, then feel free to keep it in the freezer.

## What is the difference between Greek yogurt and regular yogurt?

Greek yogurt contains less lactose and more protein than regular yogurts. It is also thicker and creamier, thanks to its high protein concentration. Greek yogurt is also easier on the stomach as it is not as rich in lactose, making it perfect for kids and adults alike who might be suffering from intolerances.

## Is Greek yogurt better than regular yogurt?

Greek yogurt and regular yogurt are both delicious and healthy. However, people who suffer from lactose intolerance should opt for Greek yogurt as it contains less lactose and can be tolerated by their stomachs. It is also better to try making your own Greek yogurts to know exactly what ingredients were used and which weren’t. There are numerous recipes online, so make sure to check them out and give them a go!

## Summary

Greek yogurt has been around since 4000 BC and is a much thicker, creamier version of regular yogurt. Natural yogurt contains bacteria that can grow in the yogurt if it is kept inside the refrigerator for too long; you should keep Greek yogurt out for an hour before eating it. There are many different recipes online for making your own Greek yogurts, and it is a good idea to try making your own Greek yogurt.
