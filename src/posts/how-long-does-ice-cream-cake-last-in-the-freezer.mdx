## How long does ice cream cake last in the freezer?

![How Long Does Ice Cream Cake Last in the Freezer](/img/how-long-does-ice-cream-cake-last-in-the-freezer-450x253.jpg "How Long Does Ice Cream Cake Last in the Freezer")

Normally an ice cream cake can last for 7 days in the freezer. But if you want to increase the lifespan of your ice cream cake, then you need to store it properly in an airtight container.

And if you are trying to store an ice cream cake which you made at home by using an ice cream maker, then make sure that it will last for 1 week only. But if any sort of ingredient is exposed to room temperature, then bacteria grows very fast. So always keep in mind that after you serve your ice cream cake, you should put it back in the freezer immediately.

## What is ice cream cake?

Ice cream cake is a frozen dessert that is made of ice cream and some other ingredients like whipped cream, cocoa powder, or chocolate syrup. It has different tastes and flavors, and you can make it at your home as well. So if you want to know more about how long ice cream cake lasts on this website, we will provide you with more information about ice cream cake.

Some of the basic ingredients of ice cream cake are:

* Whipped cream
* Sponge cake
* Ice cream
* sugar, eggs, and flour
* chocolate syrup
* Vanilla extract

So these are the basic ingredients of ice cream cake, and you can make any flavor by using these ingredients. And if you want to add anything else to your ice cream cake, then you should add that ingredient before making the ice cream. Using other ingredients before making the base or foundation of ice cream causes contamination and makes bacteria grow quickly.

## How to tell if ice cream cake has gone bad?

It is not easy to judge a bad ice cream cake easily. However, if you pay close attention, you can easily find a spoiled ice cream cake.

Here are some points that you need to check in a bad cake.

### Mold

If any kind of dairy product is exposed to room temperature, then mold starts growing in it. And if you find this type of situation with your ice cream cake, then throw it away immediately because this is a very dangerous condition. Even after the lifespan of an ice cream cake ends, you should not eat it.

### Watery ice

You can find this as a sign of bad ice cream also. It may be possible that some sort of ingredient is not mixed properly. So if you find this in your ice cream cake, then throw it away immediately because it is dangerous for human health.

### Frosty ice

This situation can be created when the weather is very humid and hot outside. And during the summer season, there are very high chances that your ice cream cake will become frosty or icy, which means that bacteria or mold has grown in your ice cream cake.

### Tasting bad

This is the most common and easy way to find out if your ice cream cake has gone bad or not. If you feel that it tastes weirder than before, then your ice cream cake is spoiled, and it should be thrown away as soon as possible. You should not eat any ice cream cake if it tastes bad or wrong.

### Ice crystals

Normally ice crystals are formed in an ice cream cake when it is stored below the freezing temperature for a long time. So if you find that your ice cream cake has formed too many ice crystals, then it means that you have kept it at a very low temperature for a long time. And eventually, your ice cream cake will spoil after that point.

## How to store ice cream cake properly?

There are certain ways that you should follow in order to keep your ice cream cake fresh. Here are some of the tips for making an ice cream cake last longer.

The first thing you have to do is keep your ice cream cake in the freezer. It would be best if you did not leave it at room temperature for a long time because that might cause spoilage of your ice cream cake.\
You need to avoid putting anything on top of an ice cream cake because whatever ingredients are there on top, such as sprinkles or sauce, will contaminate your ice cream cake, which can ultimately spoil it.

You should try to use a plastic container instead of using the glass bowls because they are very sensitive, and if you use them, then there are chances that they might break, which can lead to contamination.\
After storing the ice cream cake in the freezer for at least 2 hours, you should take it out and put it in an airtight container. If you leave your ice cream cake exposed to the air, then that might cause spoilage of the ice cream cake.

And when you are about to eat your ice cream cake, then defrost it for about 20 minutes. After that, cut it into pieces and serve immediately.

## How long does ice cream cake last outside the freezer?

Keeping an ice cream cake outside the freezer is not a good idea as it will melt down and start to spoil immediately. So if you are thinking of storing an ice cream cake outside the fridge or freezer, then it will only last for 3-4 hours.

## Conclusion

You should always keep ice cream cake in the freezer, and in that case, you can easily store it for 2 weeks. But never leave it outside the freezer as it will spoil very fast.
