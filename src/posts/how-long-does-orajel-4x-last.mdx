## How long does Orajel last for babies?

Benzocaine is one of the active ingredients used in Orajel. This can irritate babies, so it is important that it only be applied when necessary. Overuse may cause narcosis, respiratory failure, and methemoglobinemia. It should not exceed the recommended dosage of 1/2 applicator (4mg) in 24 hours.

## Will Orajel kill your toothache?

Orajel can temporarily numb the area and help you deal with tooth pain, but it will not heal the root cause of the problem. If you have a high fever, swelling, or any other concerning issues, see your doctor as soon as possible. This will help ensure that the problem doesn’t get worse.

## What if Orajel 4x is swallowed?

Orajel is generally safe to swallow, but you should seek emergency assistance if it has been ingested in large amounts. Large amounts can cause sleepiness, high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, and seizures. Don’t induce vomiting, and if the person is unconscious, don’t leave them alone. Call poison control or dial 911 for help.
