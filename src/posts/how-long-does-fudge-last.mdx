## What is a Fudge?

Fudge is a candy made from sugar, butter, and milk. It also contains chocolate or peanut butter. Some people like to add nuts as well. **[Fudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudge)** is normally creamier than hard candy because of the fat content in it.

## How long does Fudge last?

Fudge can be stored at room temperature for about two weeks. Some people like to make it and give it as a gift during the holidays such as Valentine’s Day, Christmas, or Easter. However, Fudge must be stored in an airtight container for it to last longer than two weeks.

## How Long Does Fudge Last in the Fridge?

If you keep a fudge in a fridge, then it can last for three weeks to one month.

## How Long Does Fudge Last After You Make it?

The Fudge should last for about a week after you make it. It needs to be stored in an airtight container.

## How long does Fudge last after being frozen?

Fudge can be frozen for up to 3 months without losing its taste or texture. I would recommend freezing the Fudge because it will last longer than three weeks.

## How Long Does Fudge Last Once Opened?

Once you have opened the Fudge, then it will last about two weeks in an airtight container. You do not want to use a regular container because too much oxygen will get into the Fudge and cause bacteria growth, leading to food poisoning.

## Can Fudge Go Bad?

This is a good question because if Fudge has a long expiration date, it can be stored for a longer time. In this case, Fudge can last as long as two years. However, it will not last as long once you open the container because it is exposed to air and bacteria from your hands.

## What if Fudge is left out?

The ideal temperature for Fudge to last is about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. If it is left out at room temperature for too long or if there was a power outage, then the Fudge will not be good anymore.

## How to Tell If Fudge Goes Bad?

Fudge that has gone bad will be hard, and there might be a blue, green, or white film on it. It may look like crystalized sugar.

There are other things as well that will indicate that Fudge is not more edible.

### **Mold**

Mold is a sign that the Fudge is bad. It might have a dark green or black color.

If it smells unpleasant, do not eat it because germs and bacteria may have developed.

Fudge should be kept at room temperature, but if there is too much heat from sunlight or other sources, then keep Fudge in the refrigerator.

### **Dryness**

Another thing that might happen is the Fudge becomes dry.

If you notice any of these things, then do not eat them. However, if you are sure it has mold or is hard to chew or swallow, then do not eat it!

### **Too Soft**

If the Fudge is very soft, then it may not be safe to eat. It is because it has absorbed too much moisture from the air, or it can signify that yeast has grown in it.

There will be bubbles and no crystals on top of the Fudge with yeast because yeast eats sugar.

However, if it has changed its color or hardened after being kept in the refrigerator, then you might be able to eat it.

### **Texture**

Fudge can also change its texture if it has gone bad. It may be slimy or sticky. Another thing that would indicate the Fudge is not good anymore is if it doesn’t hold together.

If you are not sure, then throw it away!

## How to Store Fudge Properly?

There are some tips to store Fudge properly and make it long-lasting.

### **Keep it in the refrigerator**

If you want Fudge to last for a long time, then keep it in the refrigerator. This will slow down the chances of bacteria growing into the Fudge.

### **Keep it Sealed Tightly**

Another way that will help is if you close the container tightly so no air or germs can get in. It is also a good idea to store it in a dark spot.

### **Use Zippered Bags for Storage**

Another good idea is to use zippered bags to store the Fudge. Food Saver bags are good because they vacuum seal to remove air, leading to mold or drying out of food. This will help Fudge last longer.

### **Temperature Control**

Make sure it is stored away from light or warm places. Make sure it is not exposed to sunlight or anything that might raise the temperature of your Fudge.

## Summary

In summary of **how long does Fudge last**, it will depend on the storage conditions. Fudge can last about two weeks if it is tightly sealed and refrigerated. It can last about 1 to 2 years if you freeze it or up to 2 months once opened.
