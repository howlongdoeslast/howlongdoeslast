  **How long does it take for turtle eggs to hatch in Minecraft?** If you are
  looking for an accurate answer, then it is 4-5 nights. In Minecraft, Once two
  turtles are bred with seagrass, one will return to its home beach. When at the
  beach, the turtle will dig into the sand and lay four eggs within a few
  seconds. Before hatching, the egg will go through three stages.


  Two turtles need to be bred in order to get eggs. So once they breed with each other, the one turtle will lay 4 eggs in the sand. These eggs can crack as well, but they will hatch in 4-7 Minecraft nights if they do not crack.


  As you know, the Minecraft day and night cycle is different from real-time, so the eggs will hatch in 80 to 100 minutes in real-time.

## How long does it take for turtle eggs to hatch in Minecraft?

![How Long Does it Take for Turtle Eggs to Hatch in Minecraft](/img/how-long-does-it-take-for-turtle-eggs-to-hatch-in-minecraft-450x253.jpg "How Long Does it Take for Turtle Eggs to Hatch in Minecraft")

The four eggs will hatch in 4-7 nights. Before hatching, every egg goes through three stages. In each stage, the egg will get cracks, and it will get more cracks as go to the next stage. So in the third stage, the egg will finally hatch.

Another fun thing that you can do in Minecraft is to farm turtle’s eggs. You need to keep turtles to feed on seagrass and then wait for the breeding.

Once the breed, one of the turtles will go back to the beach and lay eggs in the sand. After 4-7 nights in Minecraft, these eggs will hatch, and thus you can farm turtles easily.

The feeding controls may differ due to the device type you are playing on. Suppose, if you are playing on an Xbox or Xbox 360, then you can use the LT button to control the feeding on seagrass, or while you are playing on a PC, you need to press right-click on that turtle that you want to stop feeding.

## Can I speed up the egg hatching process in Minecraft?

The normal hatching process will take 4 nights or 80-100 minutes in real-time. If you are looking for a speed up, you can always spawn an adult turtle on Minecraft, equivalent to ten turtles.

You can also feed the adult turtle with 20 bowls of its favorite food, bird’s nest soup. So once the spawned turtle is fed, then it will immediately lay eggs, and you can also collect them.

You will also need to protect your eggs as zombies, skeletons, wolves, and ocelots can break these eggs anytime.

## Conclusion

Keep in mind that turtles need to go back to their blocks in order to lay eggs. And after a maximum of 7 nights, the eggs will hatch, and before hatching, eggs will pass through three hatching stages. Also, you need to close 128 blocks if you want to grow these eggs.

I hope your question is answered here and if you have any other questions, then feel free to ask me in the comment section.
