## How Long does Pumpkin Pie Last at Room Temperature?

* **Room Temperature** – 1 – 2 days
* **Refrigerator** – 3 – 4 days
* **Freezer** – 1-2 months

## How long is Pie good for on the counter?

If you leave a piece of pumpkin pie out overnight, it will be bad by the morning.

If you leave a piece of pumpkin pie out for a couple of hours, the amount of time it’s good for goes up. If you have only eaten a small piece, then there is no way that it would be bad to eat after being out for just an hour or two. But if you’re going to keep eating slices from this one Pie all day long, then it’s not going to be safe after a couple of hours at room temp.

Four hours is the absolute longest amount of time you should keep pumpkin pie sitting in an empty baking dish, uncovered on your kitchen counter. Anything more than that, and there’s a chance for bacteria like ecoli to grow in the Pie, which will make you very sick.

Pumpkin pie lasts longer on the counter when it’s in an airtight container, like Tupperware. It will still go bad within 4 hours, but you’ll be able to enjoy it for a few more hours than if you left it out on the baking dish.

## How long is pumpkin pie good in Freezer?

If you want to keep pumpkin pie for an extended period of time without it becoming inedible, then freezing it is your best bet.

Pumpkin pie stays good for up to 3 months when it is frozen. If you freeze the entire Pie after it’s been baked or freeze pieces of pumpkin pie straight out of the oven, it’ll last for the same amount of time.

You can also freeze leftover pumpkin pie, whether you have a couple of pieces left or if there’s only a little bit left. Just remember to put it in an airtight container so it doesn’t pick up other flavors and smells, and so that moisture and condensation don’t get on the rest of your stuff.

When pumpkin pie is stored in the Freezer, it also stays good for less time when it’s been cut into pieces. This stems from something called “freezer burn.” whenever you leave anything out at room temperature for an extended period of time, it’ll pick up any little thing that’s floating around. A piece of pumpkin pie is no exception.

## How to determine if the Pie goes Bad?

When pumpkin pie starts to go bad, you’ll notice that it doesn’t look as appetizing as it should. The crust may start to take on a brownish color and will begin to soften.

The filling of pumpkin pie is what you should be more concerned about, though. If the inside of your Pie has changed from an orange-yellowish color to a greenish one, then it has gone bad.

The more of a color difference between the crust and the filling, the farther along the Pie has gone in terms of spoilage. If you cut into your Pie and see mold growing on top of it or if it smells rancid when you open up your container, it’s time to get rid of the Pie.

You should always be able to use your senses to determine if pumpkin pie has gone bad or how long it’s been sitting around. If you have a particularly strong sense of smell, you’ll be able to pick up on any foreign odors wafting from the Pie, and that could help you to recognize spoilage.

The same goes for if you have a particularly excellent sense of sight. You’ll be able to notice any changes in color and texture, which will be another indication of spoilage.

The taste test is also a good way to tell whether or not your Pie has gone bad. Just a tiny bite off the corner should do the trick. If it doesn’t taste right, that’s because the Pie has gone bad.

You could always play it extra safe by throwing away pumpkin pie whenever you can’t remember how long ago you made it. There’s no harm in erring on the side of caution when it comes to your health!

## How to Store the Pumpkin Pie?

If you want to keep your pumpkin pie fresh for as long as possible, the best thing you can do is to store it in an airtight container and put it in the fridge.

**[Pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie)** stored this way will last for up to 4 days. If you want to eat pumpkin pie for breakfast on day 5, go ahead!

Pumpkin pie is also great when it’s been frozen. You’ll get a much longer shelf life out of your Pie if it’s in the Freezer, but that does come with some caveats.

Freezing pumpkin pie comes with a caveat called “freezer burn.” when you freeze something for too long, water will start to collect on the surface and freeze. This strips away some flavors and takes on a more unpleasant texture.

Freezer burn can be minimized by putting your Pie in an airtight container before freezing it. Just remember to leave about 1/2 inch between the top of your container and the surface of your Pie so that no water can collect there while it’s chilling.

Freezing pumpkin pie also makes it more susceptible to picking up any scents around it. If you want to freeze your Pie, you should put it somewhere away from anything else that might be lingering in the Freezer, like, say, fish or other pies.
