## How long does fresh hummus last?

|                          |            |             |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| **Fresh** **Hummus**     | **Fridge** | **Freezer** |
| Unopened Packaged Hummus | 3-10 Days  | 6-8 Months  |
| Unopened Homemade Hummus | 3-5 Days   | 6-8 Months  |
| Opened packed            | 4-6 Days   | —           |
| Opened hamade            | 3-5 Days   | —           |

Store-bought hummus can last for one week, and homemade hummus can stay fresh for 4 days. Hummus spoilage happens because of anaerobic bacteria that feed on hummus’s vegetable fats. When stored improperly, these bacteria can grow exponentially at room temperature.

If the product is left out for too long, it will start to acquire a sour taste and smell unpleasant. This won’t cause any foodborne illnesses, though, at least not until you eat enough of it that your stomach becomes upset.

## How long should you keep hummus at room temperature?

It is advised that you should always keep the hummus in the fridge even if it is not opened. You can only leave it outside for 3 to 4 hours, and after that, it will start spoiling. Once opened, you must put it inside the fridge.

## How to tell if hummus is bad?

If you want to know whether your hummus is edible or spoiled, you need to pay attention to some factors.

### Smell it

The first thing you should do while checking whether your hummus has gone bad or not is to smell it. If the smell seems weird, then you are better off throwing it away.

### Look at the color

Once the freshness of your hummus is compromised, its color will change. It will get darker, and you will notice a white layer of fat if you look closely.

### Taste it

The best way to check whether your hummus has gone bad is to taste it. A bad hummus will taste too salty, and its texture will be changed then; you should throw it away immediately.

Once you have checked all these factors and determined that your hummus is still okay to be eaten, you need to know how long the hummus lasts. If it was not spoiled during your inspection, you could store it in the refrigerator for another day or two. However, if the food has been left out for three days or more, throw it away because there is a big chance that it has already started spoiling.

It is also advisable to check whether any mold spots are growing on the surface of your hummus. You should do this by taking a spoon and removing 1 teaspoon of the product from the container. If you see dark green or black spots, it means that your hummus has gone bad.

## What is the expiration date of hummus?

You should always check the label of your hummus for an expiration date. The best before date indicates how long you can keep a product fresh in the fridge, and after that, it will go bad even if you put it in the freezer.

## How do you store hummus?

If you want to know how to store hummus, don’t forget to put it in an airtight container and keep it in the fridge. Also, if there is any spillage, you should wipe it up with a paper towel. Hummus that has gone bad will suffer two changes – color and texture changes. If you see that your hummus has changed its color, then throw it away immediately because this means that harmful bacteria have started to grow inside the product. If you are not eager to throw it away just because of a color change, then you should sniff it. If it smells bad, then do not eat it even if it does not look spoiled.

Once you have opened your hummus or homemade hummus package, you need to store it properly. You can do that by putting it in an airtight container and closing the lid tightly. Then put it inside the fridge where it will last for up to 3 days. If you want to store it for a longer time than this, then put it in the freezer, where it will keep fresh for up to six months.

After checking all these factors, if you think that your hummus is not spoiled and can be eaten even after 3 days, you need to know how long it lasts. If refrigerated, hummus will stay fresh for up to 3-4 days even if it has been opened. But if you want to extend its shelf life, you should put the lid tight and store it in the freezer for up to six months.

## Is hummus bad for you?

Generally, hummus is considered a healthy food, but salt and oil make it unhealthy. So if you are not willing to compromise on its taste, then eat it in moderation. One certainty that can be said about hummus is that fresh hummus is always better.

## Can you freeze hummus?

Yes, you can freeze hummus very easily. You need to remove it from the refrigerator in order to do this and put it inside the freezer. Once you have put it inside the freezer, make sure that all the air is squeezed out of its container because if there is any air left, it will create ice crystals that are not good for your health.

Once you have taken it out of the freezer, thaw it for about 15 minutes. Then stir well and serve. It is unsafe to keep hummus in the freezer for more than 6 months.

## Conclusion

To ensure that fresh hummus lasts for a long time, you need to store it in inappropriate conditions. If your hummus is stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container, it will stay good for up to 3 days. But if you are planning to eat it after 3 days or more, then make sure that there are no signs of mold growth. If you are unsure whether it is still safe to eat, then take a teaspoon of hummus and inspect it closely. If there are any dark spots or mold growing on the surface, then discard them immediately.
