## How long does a concrete burial vault last?

The average life of a burial vault is 100 years. If there is no high pressure or no high effect on the burial vault, then its life can be long up to 100 years.

If there is any high-pressure soil, like clay soil, you should check your vault after 10-15 years if it is still ok. If not, replace it with a new one. Till 15 years, you will see the color of the vault is brown, and after 15, it becomes grey or white.

## How to last longer concrete vault?

If you want to keep your burial vault for a long time, then you should use a thin piece of plywood covered with fabric to make a liner inside the burial vault. The thin sheet of plywood will help soil from caving in on upper grave plots, keeping the vault in good condition for longer.\
If you want to increase the life span of your burial vault, then also follow these tips suggested by cemetery workers:

First, it should be placed at least 3 feet below ground. Then, avoid putting large rocks on top of it because this can press down on the lid and damage the casket.\
Lastly, use a thin piece of plywood covered with fabric to make a liner inside the burial vault. The sheet of plywood will help soil from caving in on upper grave plots, keeping the vault in good condition for longer.

## Are burial vaults waterproof?

No, they are not waterproof. Vault is designed to prevent natural erosion of soil around the gravesite, and Therefore it should be placed at a minimum of 3 feet below ground level.

## How to tell if concrete burial vault has gone bad?

If you see the color of the vault is white, it means the burial vault has gone bad. But if there are any cracks or holes, you should replace the concrete burial vaults with new ones.\
But before buying a new vault, check your old vault completely with these points:

First thing first – check for an outside appearance like cracks and holes. Then, check the inside lining to see if it has any leaks causing water to leak into the vault.

Last but not least, check for soil erosion or caving in at the top level around the vault. If you see this, you should replace your burial vaults with a new one because old ones can’t handle the pressure after some time.

These are some factors that can affect the life span of burial vaults, although if you take care of your vault and follow the guidelines given by cemetery workers, you can increase its life span.

## Do burial vaults collapse?

If you are looking to purchase a cemetery vault for your loved one, then the first thing that will probably come into mind is whether or not this device crumbles.\
