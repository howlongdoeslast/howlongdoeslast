  Concerts last for hours but are not usually longer than four hours. They go on
  for about an hour and a half to two hours, usually if it’s a headliner. When
  you look at the schedule, the opening acts will play at least 30 minutes
  before the headliner comes out; they often don’t get on until after the opener
  is done playing.


  When there are two main acts, the headliner will play for an hour to an hour and a half, then someone else will play another 30 minutes or so before bringing the first act back out because the second opening act was just that–an opening act. Sometimes you have three or even four opening acts play before the headliner, which can drag out the show to about three or four hours.


  Most shows will start around 7 p.m., but you should check the schedule before you go because if it’s not a headliner, they may come on earlier than that–especially if it’s an all-day music festival type of thing, I’m talking like Warped Tour or something like that

## How Many Types of Music Concerts?

There are many different types of music concerts. One of these is a rock concert.

### Rock Concert Timing

Rock concerts typically last around 2-3 hours, including an opening act and headliner. Pop shows can vary in time depending on the artist being played, but it’s usually not more than 3 hours long unless there are multiple artists.

Greatest Hits-type concerts or those with one main artist play for about 2 hours as well. Those types of shows often go on for very long periods of time–famous artists like Madonna can put on a show that will last up to 4 hours (while the music is continuous and there aren’t any breaks in between).

Concerts with very long sets like these are uncommon. They will often happen at music festivals or when an artist makes a comeback (like Justin Timberlake now, whose setlist was 2 hours and 22 minutes long).

### Education Concerts Last Longer

The educational concerts last longer than the regular music concerts because they’re meant to enrich your knowledge about what you’re learning about.

Music concerts are meant for you to have a good time and enjoy the music, while the educational concerts actually give you some information that you can use in order to become a better person.

### Rap Concert Timing

Rap concerts are typically about 2-3 hours long. While the opening acts will only play for about 30 minutes to an hour, there can be multiple headliners that each performs for an hour or so.

These types of shows are very popular in hip hop dance clubs and lounges because they have DJs playing in between sets by different rappers, which can definitely make the show drag on.

### Classical Concert Timing

Orchestral concerts in the classical music tradition (i.e., Western art music) typically last anywhere from forty to ninety minutes, with some symphonies lasting up to two hours, like the Ninth Symphony written by Beethoven.

However, at a typical concert with an orchestra, you will only hear about half of the symphony being played. This is due to the fact that most pieces of classical music have four distinct movements or sections, and an orchestra will only play two movements at a time. Orchestras also tend to play long pieces in sequence as a complete work, rather than separately as single movements.

### Jazz Concerts Timing

Jazz concerts (and other types of jazz such as Dixieland and blues) can last anywhere from forty-five minutes to four hours. This is dependent upon the type of music that is being played. If it’s a big band playing orchestral versions of popular songs, then it could end in three or four hours; if it’s a smaller band playing Dixieland-style music, it will probably be closer to four hours.

### Festival Concert Timing

Some festival concerts can be anywhere from eight to twelve hours long, depending upon the line-up of artists that are scheduled for the festival.

### Blues Concert Timing

Blues concerts typically last between one and a half hours and four hours but can vary depending upon where you’re seeing it. If you’re at a blues club, then it will be closer to the one and a half hour range, but if you’re at a festival, then it will probably last four hours.

### Pop Concert Timing

It’s typical for pop concerts to last around an hour and fifteen minutes, with some lasting up to two hours. Pop concerts are very light compared to other types of music, so they can last as short as an hour and fifteen minutes or go on for longer, depending upon how much dancing there is, what type of artists are at the concert, and how long the opening acts are.

### Country Concert Timing

A country concert can last from one to a half hours up to five hours if it’s a festival with multiple artists performing. The time for this will vary depending upon the length of each performance and how long the opening acts are.

## What Factors affect the long lasting of a concert?

A few different factors will determine the long-lasting of a concert, and here these are mentioned below.

### Duration of Concert

The first factor that will determine the long lasting of a concert is its duration. The duration also counts for how long it can last. If it’s an hour, they probably go on for one hour only, but if it’s four hours, they probably go on for four hours or more depending upon the type of music and what they are performing.

### Genre of Concert

Secondly, the genre of music will determine how long a concert lasts as not all types of music last for the same duration. For example, Classical concerts, which are considered to be one of the longest lasting compared to other genres such as pop and jazz, have a short lasting time span.
