## How to store it properly?

When you buy buttermilk, make sure that you shake the container well. After that, put it in the fridge and keep it in the back where the temperature is cold. You can also freeze it in the original container or you can pour it in a freezer-safe bag. Make sure that you remove as much air as possible before sealing the bag. When you want to use it, thaw it in the fridge overnight.

Do not microwave it because it will change the texture and flavor.

### Storing in the Fridge

The best way to store buttermilk is in a refrigerator. The ideal temperature for this dairy product is 38-40 degrees Fahrenheit. When you store it in the fridge, make sure that you shake the container before each use. This will ensure that the ingredients are well combined.

Also, make sure that if you are not going to use it frequently then try to place it on the very backside of the fridge. The front side of the fridge changes in temperature due to frequent door opening. So, this will not be the ideal place to store it.

### Storing in the Freezer

If you want to store buttermilk for a longer time then you can freeze it. The freezing temperature should be 0 degrees Fahrenheit or less. When you freeze it, make sure that you pour it into an airtight container. This will prevent the formation of ice crystals. Also, when you want to use it, let it thaw in the fridge overnight. Do not try to microwave it because it will change the texture and flavor.
