## How Long Does a Ring Battery Last?

With regular use, a ring battery can last for one year. However, you can extend up to two years. This duration depends on how often and for how long the ring is used. Also, keep in mind that your usage pattern and regularity matter a lot while judging how long does ring battery last.

For example, if you use the ring every day but only for half an hour, it may decrease the battery’s lifespan to 6 months. Whereas if you use it for five hours a day, then the battery will last approximately one year. Additionally, using different modes also affects your ring battery life.

## Factors That Affect Ring Battery Life

The factors that affect ring battery life are:\
Usage pattern and regularity, heat, Voltage, Technology or software updates, and finally, the age of the device.

### Usage Patterns

To prevent the ring battery from getting discharged quickly, you need to follow a proper usage pattern and regularity. By doing so, you can increase its life span as well as your satisfaction with it. Like everything else, if you take care of what you have, then it will stay with you for a long time.

### Heat

The second factor that affects ring battery life is heat. When your device warms up too much, the battery starts to lose its stamina and might become useless within a few hours. So please avoid direct contact with heating devices or in a place where it may get heated during use. Don’t leave your device in a car during hot summer days or inside a drawer full of warm clothes.

### Voltage

The third factor is voltage. If your ring’s voltage is low, it will affect its battery life and performance as well. Ensure that you recharge it when the indicator shows one bar left on the device’s display. Some people tend to ignore this and leave it recharging overnight. This is bad for the ring battery as well as your health!

### Software Updates

The last and most important factor affecting ring battery life is software updates and age. The older it gets, the more its performance issues and less power capacity to keep it running will be. So ensure you update your device with the latest software updates available on manufacturers or network providers’ websites. Also, try to keep your device as new as possible.
