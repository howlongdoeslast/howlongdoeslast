  Football game is the most popular game in the whole world. People are very
  fond of watching and playing football. So if you want to know ***how long is a
  football game?*** Then this article is for you. The football game has
  different duration depending on the level of the game. The professional match
  in many leagues like NFL (American Football), EPL (English Premier League),
  and S-League (Singaporean premier football league) is 90 minutes long,
  including 15-minute halftime intervals.


  The football game can end when both teams have the same points on the table. Many leagues have a different system with the top two teams qualifying for the Super Bowl or championship game. There is no sudden death in football in these cases, as it can end as a tie. Higher ranked teams will reach the finals as they finish their games before other teams.


  It’s been found that a lower-ranked team has the lowest playing time in knock-out matches. Teams with fewer chances of winning have to settle with penalties that take less than 90 minutes.


  The football game can also end when a team scores more goals than another, making it impossible for the other team to win the match. It results in the victory of the leading team which wins by two or more goals.


  In the case of a tie, if both teams have equal points at the standing table, they play an extra time to decide the winner. Again this extra time is 15 minutes, and if no team scores a goal even after that, it goes on with a penalty shootout. Let us not forget the halftime break of 15 minutes for players to change their position after the match.
