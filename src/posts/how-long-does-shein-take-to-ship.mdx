## How Long Does Shein Take To Ship?

![How Long Does Shein Take To Ship?](/img/how-long-does-shein-take-to-ship-300x169.jpg "How Long Does Shein Take To Ship?")

**SHEIN can take 2-3 weeks to ship** your order to your doorstep when if you are using express shipping. **Regular shipping can take up to 8 weeks** to deliver to your doorstep. Also, in this shipping time, the processing period is excluded which is 2 or 3 days.

The main reason for this time frame is because some of the products are ordered from overseas. Once your order has shipped, it will take 6-7 business days to get to you via regular mail service (UPS, FedEx). This shipping period is similar for the following states:

* California
* Network
* Florida
* Texas

## How long does it take for an order to be processed?

SHEIN orders are generally processed within a day or two of being received. Orders are not processed over the weekend, so if you place an order on Friday afternoon, it may not be processed until the next Monday. If your order is placed on a Saturday or Sunday, it will be processed as quickly as possible and shipped as soon as possible after that.

## How to track SHEIN orders in the US, NZ, Philippines, Canada, & Australia?

Any SHEIN order tracking process is very simple and easy for everyone. Whether you live in the United States or Malaysia, you can track your order by going to the SHEIN website and clicking on your account. You will need to log in before accessing all of your information, such as checking rates and tracking orders. Once logged in, just click “orders” and then click “View Order Details.”

For almost all countries listed above, you can use EMS as a carrier to track your SHEIN order. If the tracking status shows “Delivery Complete,” but you still have not received the package, please contact them via Live Chat or email us at support@shein.com.

## What can cause a delay in SHEIN shipment?

Some factors can prolong the shipment period of Shein parcels. You can check those factors below.

### Size of the Parcels

Shein is trying to get you your order as soon as possible. However, shipping speed is determined by the weight limit of the country you are ordering from. The more items in your cart, the longer it will take for your order to be shipped. We would not recommend that you buy more than several kilograms worth of clothing or other products at a time.

### The Postal Service Schedule

The schedule is an important factor that influences delivery speed. Due to its business hours, USPS cannot deliver on weekends or listed holidays. If you need something urgently, please be aware of the carrier’s schedule before placing an order to avoid surprises regarding your SHEIN shipment.

### Clerical Errors

Shein takes pride in their products and customer service, which leads to the smallest of details being checked. However, if you have made a mistake on your order, such as the size, color, quantity, or any other clerical errors that lead to a delay in processing time, then please contact their support team immediately via Live Chat or email us at support@shein.com so we can fix the error and ship your order as soon as possible.

Shein encourages all of their buyers to contact our support team if they have any questions regarding an order or about SHEIN in general. We will be more than happy to help you resolve any issues that may arise with your SHEIN shipment.
