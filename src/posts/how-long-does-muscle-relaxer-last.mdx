  A muscle relaxer is a drug or medication that is used to treat muscle spasms, tightness, and tension. Muscle relaxers are not for everyone, though. Some patients have been known to experience hallucinations from taking this medication. It should never be taken unless a doctor has prescribed it – even if the person has been in an accident or experienced some sort of injury that was worsened by a lack of mobility.

## How long does muscle relaxer last in your system?

![How long does muscle relaxer last in your system?](/img/how-long-does-muscle-relaxer-last-300x169.jpg "How long does muscle relaxer last in your system?")

A muscle relaxer can stay in your system for four to eight hours. Once you take a muscle relaxer, it will start to kick in your system after 20 to 30 minutes. It is even more effective when it is taken on an empty stomach.

## What are some common brands of muscle relaxers?

There are some common brands that you can check in the below list.

* Flexeril
* Cyclobenzaprine
* Skelaxin
* Ativan/Lorazepam
* Ambien
* Valium
* Xanax

## What is the difference between muscle relaxers and anti-convulsants?

Muscle relaxers are considered safe for individuals that do not have any kidney or liver issues. Anti-convulsant, however, is only prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or seizure disorders.

## When should you take a muscle relaxer?

Muscle relaxers should not be taken on a regular basis but rather periodically to counteract muscle spasms. Muscle relaxers are often prescribed for individuals that have had an injury or accident and need additional pain relief from tightness or tension. Many celebrities, such as Madonna and Jerry Seinfeld, have taken this drug during various performances to help loosen up their muscles.

However, if someone needs to take a muscle relaxer regularly, it could indicate that the person needs to seek professional advice from a doctor regarding their condition.

## What are the side effects?

There are some common side effects that most muscle relaxers have. They include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Drowsiness or sedation
* Headache
* Dry mouth
* Loss of appetite
* Blurred vision
* Urinary retention
* Lightheadedness or dizziness
* Weakness, lack of coordination
* Nervousness, restlessness
* Heartburn
* Constipation

## What are the factors that influence how long a muscle relaxer stays in your system?

There are some factors that can influence how long the muscle relaxer stays in your system:

* Age and weight of the person taking muscle relaxers
* Your genetics and metabolism rate
* Whether there was any food intake before taking muscle relaxers The severity of your overall health condition
* Amount of dosage consumed

So these factors have strong influences on a person’s system after taking muscle relaxers. There are ways that can affect how long muscle relaxers last in your system that you should know about. For example, it is important to have a full stomach before taking this medication because having food in the digestive tract will slow down the absorption of the medicine into the bloodstream, which means it will take longer for the drug to work.

“Note: this article does not cover all possible directions, side effects, or precautions. Please consult a doctor before taking muscle relaxers.”

## How long does a muscle relaxer stay in your blood, urine, hair & saliva?

Muscle relaxers taken orally are often broken down in the liver and then excreted from your body. However, when someone takes a muscle relaxer intravenously, it will leave the body very quickly because there is no need for the drug to be processed by a liver or metabolized in a gastrointestinal tract.

Depending on the type of medication you are taking, the amount of time that it would take to be eliminated from your system ranges. For instance, if someone takes Lorazepam orally, it can remain in their system for up to four days after the cessation.

The same thing applies when an individual takes Soma or Flexeril because it can stay in the system for up to four days. However, if someone takes Ativan, Xanax, or Valium, it will be eliminated within two days after the cessation.

Since muscle relaxers are broken down by your liver and then excreted from your body through your kidneys when you have kidney disease, this can cause the drug to be broken down more slowly. This means that the muscle relaxers can stay in your system for a longer time than normal.

It is important to note that muscle relaxers can be present in saliva, blood, hair, and urine samples for up to four days after you have stopped taking them. To ensure that the drug has been eliminated from your system, you will have to undergo a **[drug test](https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/drug-testing/)**.

Drug tests are common in many situations; for example, drivers must submit to drug testing before getting behind the wheel of their car, and many employers conduct random drug tests. If you are taking muscle relaxers, you do not drive or apply for any job within 24 hours of taking the medication because it may show up on a drug screening.

## Conclusion

Since there are many different factors that can play into how long the muscle relaxer stays in your system, you should always consult with a doctor. They will determine if the medication is right for you and how to take it to eliminate it from your system quickly properly.
