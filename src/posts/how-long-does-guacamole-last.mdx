## How long does guacamole last?

The answer depends on some factors like are you talking about homemade or store-bought guacamole, and if it’s been refrigerated or not.

Homemade guacamole usually lasts around 3 days in the fridge. But if you’ve added onion or garlic, it will only last about 1 day because those foods are high in bacteria.

Store-bought guacamole usually lasts around 7 days in the fridge, but it really depends on the ingredients and how it’s been processed.

If you are asking about Wholly guacamole then it is also needed to refrigerate and it can last up to 14 days.

* **Texture:** It should be relatively smooth and creamy. If it’s lumpy or watery, it might not be safe to eat.
* **Color:** It should be a light green or yellow color. If it’s brown or black, it’s probably been exposed to oxygen for too long and is no longer safe to eat.

* **Mold and wateriness:** If there is any visible mold or if it’s watery, it’s not safe to eat.
