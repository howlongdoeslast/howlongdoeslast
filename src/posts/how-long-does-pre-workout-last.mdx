## How Long Does Pre Workout Take to Kick In?

A pre-workout can take 15-45 minutes to kick in your bloodstream. So it is advised to take your pre-workout 30-45 minutes before you hit the gym. However, some pre-workouts may go into your bloodstream quickly, so 30 minutes are ok to take these supplements before you go to the gym.

## How Long Does Pre Workout Stay in Your System?

There is no specific time period for determining how long a pre-workout will stay in your system because there are a number of factors that affect the long-lasting time.

For example, here are some of the factors that will decide the pre-workout life in your system.

* Age, weight, sex, and body mass
* Level of hydration
* Body fat percentage
* Diet and other medication.

However, if we take a rough idea, then a pre-workout can stay in your system from 1 hour to 3 hours.

It is advised that if you are not done with your workout or exercise, never ever take a pre-work supplement because it may stay in your system for longer hours which can cause adverse effects. So, make sure to finish your workouts before taking any supplements.

## How Long Does Pre Workout Actually Last?

As I mentioned before, a pre-workout can stay in your system for 15-45 minutes, but it really depends on some factors. Like,

### **Your Body Type**

The first thing that will affect your system’s duration of pre-workout is your body type. Suppose you are bulkier, then obviously, the impact of pre-workout will not last long. Similarly, if your body fat percentage is low or high, then the pre-workout impact will react accordingly.

### **Volume**

The next thing is the volume of pre-workout that you have consumed. The more is the quantity; your bloodstream will absorb, the more doses. And the excess amount of pre-workout can cause adverse effects rather than doing any benefit to you.

### **Drugs and Medication**

If you are under-recovery from any disease or taking any drug or medication, then it may affect your body badly when your bloodstream absorbs a hefty dose of supplements.

### **Amount of Water Intake**

The amount of water intake basically decides how fast the pre-workout supplement will get dissolved and enter into your bloodstream and produce effects or results on your body. If you are fully hydrated, then it is obvious that the concentration of ingredients will increase, which also increases the half-life of a pre-workout supplement.

But, if you are dehydrated and do not take enough water, then the impact of pre-workout will be minimal, and it will not last long as well.

### **Quality of Pre Workout**

The quality of pre-workout also depends on many factors. If you are using a branded pre-workout supplement, it will obviously have quick action and long-lasting effects as well. Another thing that is considered here is the ingredients of a pre-workout supplement.

A good pre-workout should have no artificial coloring, additives, preservatives, and it should be GMO-free.

If you are buying a pre-workout supplement form online, then always read the ingredients list to check whether it is good for your health or not. And one thing is also mentioned here: never ever take a pre-workout with a high amount of caffeine in it because too much caffeine intake can have adverse effects on your system.

So, if you are taking a pre-workout supplement, then try to buy an original product from a branded company. Also, please do not take more than one pre-workout of different companies simultaneously because it may adversely affect your body.
