How long does Xeomin last?

![How Long Does Xeomin Last?](/img/how-long-does-xeomin-last-1-300x169-1-.jpg "How Long Does Xeomin Last?")

The simple answer is 4 months. Xeomin injections typically last 4 months but there are some factors that will determine if someone can enjoy Xeomin results for longer.

It is recommended to return every 4 months after the injection because this will ensure that the effects remain optimal. After this time period, it is best to visit your doctor again for another injection until you reach the desired result.

The main factor that results in Xeomin lasting shorter or longer is the dosage of 20 units. Since Xeomin injections are performed using very small amounts, one injection may only last up to 3 months for some people. However, depending on your need and requirements you can always repeat this treatment until it works best for your face.

## What is the time duration of Xeomin treatment?

The average time that can take about 4-6 minutes to treat each area like forehead, between eyebrows, under eyes, turkey neck, and glabellar area.

## How does Xeomin Works?

XEOMIN® is a treatment for wrinkles based on the natural effects of the protein, “botulinum toxin.” Botulinum toxin acts as a neuromodulator – XEOMIN relaxes and smoothes overlying muscles in the area where it is injected.

Botox in aesthetic treatments can achieve wrinkles reduction – by changing muscle contractions. The injections create temporary paralysis to nearby facial muscles, decreasing their activity for up to 4 months; this reduces wrinkling and creates a smoother appearance of those areas.

Xeomin makes some people look like they were born with **[good skin](https://howlongdoeslast.info/hyaluron-pen/)**, just because it has an excellent soft-to-skin side effect curve: no visible muscle weakness, hardly any change noticed during everyday activities, and also no change in the resting face.

## How much does Xeomin cost per unit?

The average cost for each unit of Xeomin is $14.41 per unit today. However, the price per unit may depend on several factors like medical procedure setting (office versus hospital), location in which you receive treatment, your insurer coverage, and also whether you purchase only one unit or need to purchase multiple units for maximum effect.

## How long does Xeomin last after reconstitution?

When Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA) is reconstituted, the potency of each vial containing 1.0 ml should be injected within 4 hours after reconstitution.

## What is the difference between **[Botox](https://howlongdoeslast.info/botox/)** and Xeomin?

There are a few differences between Botox and Xeomin like:

### Botox

Botox injections may require more treatments to get the same results as in one session of treatment with Xeomin

### Xeomin

Xeomin causes less pain, redness, and swelling than Botox so it is an easier and better option than Botox injection.

## How long will it take to get rid of wrinkles?

The effects of Xeomin treatment usually last up to 4 months, but that can vary. Results are not permanent, but if you come back for another treatment at four months, your wrinkles will be kept to a minimum.

## Is Xeomin treatment painful?

The Xeomin treatment is associated with mild discomfort and the injections only take a few minutes. So it’s not much different from other wrinkle treatments.

## What can I expect during treatment?

The Xeomin treatment takes several minutes depending on how many areas are being treated. Each area is numbed separately, which can take about 10 minutes in total or 15-20 for glabella.

## How to make Xeomin last longer?

Below are some tips that you can follow to make your Xeomin treatment longer than 4 months. So let’s have a look.

### Avoid direct sunlight/Use sunscreen

Being outdoors may result in the Xeomin wearing off faster than 4 months. So use sunscreen and avoid direct sunlight, to prevent it from wearing off early.

### Protect your face with cold compresses

During the treatment keep protecting your face/skin with cold compresses, so that it can work for a longer time. Apply ice packs or cold compresses immediately after injections for 15 minutes.

### Protect your face with sweat-free primer before applying make-up

Sweat can break down the Xeomin faster, so use a good quality sweat-free primer before applying it to make up to protect the Xeomin from sweating away. And also do not apply powder foundation on top of the makeup, as they do contain oil in them.

### Drink lots of water

Drinking plenty of water is another good way to make your Xeomin last longer. Water helps in flushing out toxins that are produced by the body; so stay hydrated.

### Give up smoking

Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which speeds up the process of Xeomin wearing off from your skin. So if possible give up smoking to ensure a longer Xeomin treatment. Also avoid drinking too much alcohol and coffee, as they contain chemicals that speed up the breakdown of toxins in your body.

### Take a multivitamin

Taking a multivitamin supplement daily will help in reducing muscle contractions naturally, which slows down the breakdown of toxins in your system. So take a multivitamin pill daily to enhance toxin removal by your body.

### Eat healthy food

Eating fresh fruits and vegetables provides antioxidants that slow down the breakdown of toxins in your body. So eat a balanced diet and also avoid junk food like pizza, to make your Xeomin treatment longer.

## What are the areas where I can get the Xeomin injection?

If you don’t know what are the body areas where you can get a Xeomin injection then you can read all the areas below.

There are some possible sides effects that you can get after the treatment.\
These are:

### Nausea, vomiting, or headaches

Some people may experience mild nausea, vomiting, and headaches after the Xeomin injection treatment. But they will go away without any medication.

### Uneven treated areas

If you got another treatment like Botox or Dysport injection before then it can lead to uneven treated areas in your face, like lumps or bumps on your skin. So make sure that you are not getting any other treatments before taking the Xeomin injection.

### Swollen eyelids

Swelling around the eyes is another possible side effect of Xeomin injection, but it will only last for a couple of days. So if swelling persists then contact your doctor.

To reduce the side effects of Xeomin you should follow some important points like:

* Not use if your skin is irritated or reddened at the treatment site
* Wash hands before treatment to avoid infection
* Do not massage, rub or apply heat on the injection site after taking Xeomin injection
* Clean treated areas with mild soap and warm water before and after the treatment
* Not use any other skincare products on the treated areas for at least 3 days
* Avoid strenuous exercise, alcohol consumption, and smoking for a day or two after Xeomin injection.

## Which medications should I avoid before taking Xeomin?

Before getting a Xeomin injection you should tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, whether they are prescribed or over-the-counter drugs.

* You should not take any blood thinners like aspirin, ibuprofen, and other painkillers for a day before getting a Xeomin injection.
* Also avoid using anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications that lower the ability of your blood to clot, a day before getting a Xeomin injection.
* You should also tell the doctor about any allergies that you have and if you have severe allergies then do not get a Xeomin injection.
* Also, avoid taking any other treatments like Botox or Dysport before taking a Xeomin shot.

## Is the treatment safe for me?

Yes, Xeomin is an **[FDA-approved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration)** treatment so it is safe and reliable for you. If in any case, you get severe side effects or problems then contact your doctor immediately.

## What is the recommended dosage of Xeomin?

The recommended dose of Xeomin is 27-33 units injected subcutaneously for treating moderate to severe glabellar lines associated with procerus and corrugator muscle activity. But you should follow the instructions given by your doctor regarding the dosage.

## How long after Xeomin can I lay down?

It would be best to wait for about 30 minutes post-injection before lying down.

## How long does Xeomin take to work?

It usually takes a few days for Xeomin to take full effect. However, you can resume your regular activities immediately after the injection.

## Can I use ice on my face after receiving an injection of Xeomin?

Yes, you can apply ice to the injected area immediately after injection to reduce pain and swelling. However, do not use heat on the same area to give your skin sufficient time to heal. This will help prevent further irritation or damage; however, make sure that the ice does not come in contact with your skin because it can cause further damage.

## Is it safe for me to use bacitracin?

No, you should avoid using bacitracin after receiving an injection because the ingredients in the ointment can minimize the effects of Xeomin. Also, make sure that you do not come into contact with any other topical products until your skin has completely healed.

## Can I receive Xeomin injections if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?

No, it is not safe to receive an injection of Xeomin while you are pregnant or breastfeeding because the effects have not been studied thoroughly. However, it has been reported that the fetus and newborn may experience side effects if a mother receives a neuromodulator injection during pregnancy.

## Can I receive Xeomin injections if I am using anesthesia?

No, you should not receive an injection of Xeomin while you are under general anesthesia because the effects have not been studied thoroughly. However, it has been reported that neuromodulation injections may cause severe side effects such as respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and seizure in patients who are under general anesthesia.

## Conclusion

Xeomin is an FDA-approved neuromodulator injection for removing visible signs of wrinkles from the face. It works by blocking nerve impulses to muscles and temporarily stopping muscle contractions. It also works by boosting the production of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which stimulates muscle contractions in facial muscles around the eyes and between **eyebrows**.

Xeomin is a safe and effective treatment to get rid of wrinkles. However, it should not be used in patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding because the effects have not been studied thoroughly under these circumstances. It should also not be used while you are under general anesthesia because severe side effects may occur during this period.
